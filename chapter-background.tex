\chapter{Background} \label{chapter-background}
The focus of this thesis is a topic that falls in the overlap  between least three academic  disciplines, Economics, Urban Geography, and Planning. The central and shared concern in this area is with geographic space.

topic 

A simple economic insight -- that locational value gives rise to land rents -- provides an organizing principle for the three disciplines where they overlap. Locational value explains the spatial distribution of human activities and the distribution of locational rents goes some distance to explaining  core social issues like class structure, inequality, political political power and the dynamics of economic development.  To understand current changes in our urban system we will examine the development of the relevant theoretical tools, beginning with classical rent theory.


Rent theory has a long history in economics, going back to thinkers such as Richard Cantillon (1680s-1734), François Quesnay (1694–1774), the marquis de Mirabeau (1715–1789) and Anne-Robert-Jacques Turgot (name physiocrat) and Adam Smith (1723-1790) and received its classic statement in Ricardo (1772-1823). Nearly contemporaneous thinker, Johann Heinrich  von Th\"unen (1783-1850) developed a planning model to guide the location of economic activities for an urban-agricultural society.  A version of that model  was reinvented in urban geography by XXX. Alonzo\footnote{We use a version of the well-established model of Alonso (1964), Muth (1969) and Mills (1967), and formalised by Wheaton (1974),}

We link the Alonzo model with more recent work on growth theory starting with Robert Solo's XXX and with the endogenous growth models of Lucas () and draw on Jane Jacobs's insight that endogenous urban growth  is. now driving economic development. Jacobs's insight is empirically supported by recent work in the complexity literature on urban scaling by XXXX ()

Figure 3: space and value

Land rent was historically the basis of the wealth and political power of  the land-owning class in the era of the classical economists.


We further link the model of urban rents to emerging concerns about the financialization of the housing market. The key insight we offer is that the financialization  of the housing sector is a  form of rent-seeking that must have detrimental effects on urban development and on the well-being of urban residents.
