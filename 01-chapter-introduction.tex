This thesis is a study of financialization in the context of housing markets.
One of the founding challenges of economics was explaining how wealth is created and distributed. Property ownership has  been a central form of wealth % one of central forms of  wealth and means of building wealth 
throughout history,  
and widely distributed property through home ownership has contributed to the wide distribution of wealth, particularly in North America \cite{pikettyCapitalTwentyfirstCentury2014}. % It is a key differentiator between who has built wealth and who hasn't. % ADD FACTS. %This is seen in the racial wealth gap, the immigrant wealth gap, and the youth wealth gap. 
Property ownership is going through a great transformation in structure, with financial capital coming to own a larger share of property,  particularly of urban land \cite{farhaReportFinancializationHousing2017, palleyFinancializationWhatIt2007}. %, is held by financial capital. 

This process has been called financialization \cite{farhaReportFinancializationHousing2017, hansenFinanceCapitalismFinancialization2014}. 
Because of this significance of property to wealth distribution, the shift to financialized ownership % this shift %/this financiazation
has big effect for distribution \cite{tomaskovic-deveyFinancializationCausesInequality2013, palleyFinancializationWhatIt2007, seccarecciaUnderstandingFinancializationHistory2013, nemtinFinancializationHousingSocial2021}. %This is accept SEEN IN XY say.  % \cite{nemtinFinancializationHousingSocial2021}, \cite{}

This thesis argues it may also have dramatic effects on the productivity of cities.

\section{The financialization of housing markets}
 % in particular it's efect on productivity.
Financialization of the housing market refers to the growth in the share of the housing stock controlled by financial institutions and investors and the overall effect this has on the outcomes of the system \cite{farhaReportFinancializationHousing2017, hansenFinanceCapitalismFinancialization2014}. 
This thesis focuses on the potential macro effects of financial capital capturing spatial urban rents.

% ***E MAYBE MOVE THIS UP... IT MIGHT BE HELPFUL CONTEXT FOR WHAT YOU ACTUALLY DO, IT BEGINS TO ESTABLISH THE PROBLEM
 % These macro effects are our main interest. % While the term financialization can be used in a variety of ways,
 % are the specific concern of this thesis.  
% These aspects of finacialization have been neglected in the literature.%in the urban system 




There's now a compelling understanding of the value that's created by cities, both empirically and theoretically \cite{jacobsEconomyCities1969, spenceUrbanizationGrowth2009, bettencourtIntroductionUrbanScience2021}, but there's no formal apparatus in standard economic theory for analyzing the distribution of the enormous value created. % that's being created. 
Standard models of the financial operations are spaceless \footnote{In describing any theory we need to identify the kinds of objects that are theorized. Financial analysis theorizes  assets, debts, flows of revenue and costs, and the rates of change or exchange of these quantities over time. These are inherently spaceless because they are accounting entities, completely independent of location. It matters where a worker or a farm is. It does not matter where and dollar or a rouble is.}. 
% since financial analysis theorizes objects such as assets, debts, revenue and cost flows, and the changes in and exchange values of their values over time. These are inherently spaceless because they are accounting entities, independent of location. It matters where a worker or a farm is. It does not matter where and dollar or a rouble is.
Our solution is to explicitly embed the normally spaceless analysis of investment decisions in a spatial model with locational rents. % to spatial rents in an urban system. % to refomulate the 

Our focus is on who captures these rents and how that affects the city. The distribution of locational rents, we believe, goes some distance to explaining core social issues like class structure, inequality, political political power. 
The ultimate goal of this work is to develop a modern urban theory of rent, linking spatial rent, housing markets, and urban production. The following sections introduce how this work fits in the literature and the basic structure the core model, then list the main contribution, and give an outline for the document.

\section{Position in the literature}
This work draws together insights from urban economics, geography, and planning. The central and shared concern all three fields is geographic space. Locational value explains the dynamics of economic development, the spatial distribution of human activities, and urban form.  

In all three disciplines, locational value gives rise to land rents, which is for us the link to distribution, financialization, and continuing productivity.  
Figure~\ref{fig-fields} illustrated both the synthetic aspect of our analysis and the direction in which we develop existing work. % The organizing principle in the spatial models of all three disciplines is an economic variable, land rent, % The three disciplines share a simple economic insight.

Classical economist David Ricardo \cite{ricardoEssayInfluenceLow1815} elaborated the theory of land rents in 1815. Johann von Th\"unen \cite{vonthunenIsolirteStaatBeziehung1826} %(1783 -- 1850) 
produced the first serious treatment of spatial economics and economic geography, apparently independently in 1826. In 1961 William Alonzo (and others) \cite{alonsoModelUrbanLand1960} applied the  Ricardian and von Th\"unen theory to the urban system, launching modern urban theory. Meanwhile in economics, Solow \cite{solowContributionTheoryEconomic1956} set off a flood of work on  economic growth growth that  spilled into urban theory through through Jacobs \cite{jacobsEconomyCities1969}, Lucas \cite{lucasMechanicsEconomicDevelopment1988} and Bettencourt et al \cite{bettencourtGrowthInnovationScaling2007}. 

% 3rd spaceless finance..
% We begin in the region of overlap among the three disciplines with the fundamental linking construct, space. 
All three fields have central theories built around %build their theories around  
the value of location, which is essentially the % we emphasize is expressed as 
locational rents, a concept well developed by classical economists like David Ricardo. Our contribution is to extend the the analysis of urban rents to take into account the effects of financialization.


\section{Modelling the financialization of an urban housing market}
% We take a step beyond integrating labour markets in a city, to studying the distributional effects: who gets the surplus, what does that mean for the class structure, and ultimately the productivity of cities. 
In order to develop an analysis of the distributional effects we have to build a model with three components: a housing market that distributes income and housing, a financialization process, and a production system. 
% The first component, the market model, is illustrated in 
% Figure~\ref{Figure-impacts} shows the main effects  that  arise from the growing financial sector participation in the housing market. 

Figure \ref{Figure-impacts} shows the first component, the market model.
It shows two primary effects financialization has on the housing market: how it allocates % The housing market allocates both 
the housing stock, and how it allocates the \glspl{rent} generated by the urban system. % as illustrated in Figure \ref{Figure-impacts}. PHRASE SO IT'S CLEAR THESE ARE EFFECTS 
% In the analysis developed in this thesis, % Our argument is that
The first effect of financialization, on housing allocation, arises because tenants replace owners. While owner-occupiers share in the growing land rents generated by urban agglomeration effects, tenants do not. As a result, a declining fraction of urban residents accumulate capital through their participation in the housing market, and therefore fewer enter the class of workers with both wage and capital income defined by John Roemer \cite{roemerGeneralTheoryExploitation1982}.

    \caption[The financialization component of the model.]{The financialization component. There is a feedback loop in which new investors drive up demand and thus drive up prices.}
\end{figure}

The second effect of financialization on the market is in the allocation of rents. Rents generated by the agglomeration economies in the urban system are diverted to largely non-resident owners, away from investment in local production or amenities. tenants replace owner-occupiers. % are gradually replaced by tenants. 


Figure \ref{fig-financial-cycle} illustrates the second component of our model, the financialization process. We develop an explicit model of investor behaviour to explain the market decisions of buyers and the role of financial capital. 
The key observation is that investors enter the housing market. In doing so they drive up prices by increasing total demand. The rising price generates an expectation of capital gains, which enter the investors' calculations. Investors have, as research shows, better access to capital than most new entrants to the housing market. When the financial sector, represented by the bank, the figure, % in Figure\ref{fig-financial-cycle}, 
makes more capital available, the pattern of ownership shifts, as illustrated above. % The theory of financialization is discussed in detail in Chapter ~\ref{chapter-financialization}.

\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig-Alonzo-Jacobs-cycle} illustrates the third component, the model of productivity incorporating agglomeration effects. %the productivity of cities, incorporates the productivity of cities.  
A fundamental feature in recent empirical work on scaling laws is % demonstrated in the recent literature on scaling laws: 
the persistent relationship between population and productivity. The productivity of cities increases superlinearly with population. Cities are the locus of a positive feedback loop with rising populations raising productivity, and rising productivity attracting more people and resources, a theoretical argument associated with the work of Jane Jacobs \cite{jacobsEconomyCities1969}, with strong empirical support from recent work on the scaling of urban productivity  \cite{bettencourtGrowthInnovationScaling2007, bettencourtOriginsScalingCities2013, dongUnderstandingMesoscopicScaling2020, loboUrbanScalingProduction2013}.

Our model brings together an urban spatial model with a model of the scaling of wealth in urban centers. %, using an approach similar to that developed in modern growth theory.
% that we discuss in Chapter ~\ref{chapter-rent}. 
% In that chapter we ground the observation in  \gls{neoclassical growth theory} and recent empirical and theoretical work on \gls{urban scaling}. 
We incorporate that scaling result into the standard urban model, building of the work of %associated with 
We call the combined model the %William Alonzo and others \cite{alonzoTheoryUrbanLand1960}, calling the combined sub-model the 
\gls{Alonzo-Jacobs cycle} because there is a positive feedback between population size and wages. This feedback loop will be vulnerable if financialization  extracts the new wealth generated by agglomeration effects, reducing wage growth and therefore the ability of the city to grow, because wage growth is what drives population growth and further agglomeration.
% We describe The Alonzo model in Chapter ~\ref{chapter-space}.
The green boxes in the figure represent the theoretical justification of the primary simplifications in the model. 
% We call the combined sub-model the \gls{Alonzo-Jacobs model}, then combine that with an approach to the scaling of wealth based on the growth and agglomeration work in Chapter \ref{chapter-growth}, on growth.

% When these components are  combined,  
Combining these three components, we have an extended theory of urban rent built on a foundation of theory that goes back to the \gls{classical economics} around the beginning of the 19$^{th}$ century and incorporating modern growth theory and modern urban theory. 

The resulting model suggests two basic hypotheses:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Financialization of the housing market will result in the tenantization of the urban middle class as financial capital acquires more of the housing stock. % vs decline of the urban middle class
    \item Financialization of the housing market will result in reduced growth of urban productivity as the flow of rents is diverted from real investment to the financial sector.
\end{enumerate} 

\section{Contributions}

The overall goal is to provide a theory of the relationship between financialization and urban productivity. The main contributions towards achieving this goal are:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item  Incorporating \gls{classical rent theory} into an \gls{agent-based} urban model. This requires modelling how \gls{Ricardian rent theory}, a theory of distribution based on an agricultural economy, applies % provides the transmission mechanism

    \item Allowing the creation and distribution of rents to influence urban growth, productivity and  population structure. This requires articulating the links between the wealth production of cities and  how urban systems evolve.

    \item Incorporating current research on \gls{urban scaling} into the core spatial urban model.  This requires drawing on empirical work to formalise the scaling relationship, which embeds productivity in an urban model. % we argue is an elegant way to model a an urban system with production. % We show how understanding how complex systems scale provides an 

    \item Constructing an urban \gls{agent-based model} that is consistent with {neoclassical growth theory}. We show how the neoclassical framework can be implemented in the agent-based framework, and make a case for the usefulness of an approach in linking urban rents and productivity. %Chapter \ref{chapter-methodology} discuses methodological implications of this approach.

    \item Integrating \gls{financial capital} into a standard spatial model of the urban system, making an explicitly spatial model of the financial structures, which have traditionally been formalized in a spaceless way.
