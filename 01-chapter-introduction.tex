\epigraph{Cities are the crucible of civilization, the hubs of innovation, the engines of wealth creation and centers of power, the magnets that attract creative individuals, and the stimulant for ideas, growth, and innovation.}{Geoffrey West \cite{westScaleUniversalLaws2017}}

Since the industrial revolution, widely distributed property ownership, particularly in North America, has contributed to the wide and relatively equal distribution of {wealth} \footnote{The role of housing in wealth accumulation is well known. After a detailed  examination of data from the US Survey of Consumer Finance (SCF) and the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID), Herbert et al. concluded that ``there continues to be strong support for the association between owning a home and accumulating wealth.'' The effect persists even among minorities and lower-income households. In lower-income minority households, on average, renters do not see any gains in wealth \cite{herbertHomeownershipStillEffective2013}.} \cite{pikettyCapitalTwentyfirstCentury2014, harrisGrowthHomeOwnership1977, chevanGrowthHomeOwnership1989, andrewsEvolutionHomeownershipRates2011}. 
However, property ownership is now going through a great transformation in structure, with financial capital coming to own a larger share of the urban land and housing stock \cite{farhaReportFinancializationHousing2017, palleyFinancializationWhatIt2007}. For the first time in Canadian history the rate of home ownership has declined, falling from---in xx to xx in xx \cite{GET_homeownership_rates}.

In Ontario, for example, 70??? \% of new housing units are owned by investors not residents \cite{GET77percent}. % (a change from .. ). 
This process has been called financialization \cite{farhaReportFinancializationHousing2017, hansenFinanceCapitalismFinancialization2014}
% There is an emerging understanding that this transformation may affect the accessibility, security, and affordability of housing. 
\cite{tomaskovic-deveyFinancializationCausesInequality2013, palleyFinancializationWhatIt2007, seccarecciaUnderstandingFinancializationHistory2013, nemtinFinancializationHousingSocial2021}.  
Financialization of the housing market refers to the growth in the share of the housing stock controlled by financial institutions and investors and the overall effect this has on the outcomes of the system \cite{farhaReportFinancializationHousing2017, hansenFinanceCapitalismFinancialization2014}.  

Financialization is increasingly understood to be a contributor  to the issues of declining affordability and rising homelessness in Canada. These issues have become so extreme in recent years that Canada is now widely understood to be in a housing crisis. The Ontario Housing Affordability Task Force, for example, reported that home ownership is now ``beyond the reach of most first-time buyers across the province ... Housing has become too expensive for rental units ... The system is not working as it should.''

% Arguably financialization, is playing an important role in this crisis of rising costs of housing. 
While discussions about whether and how financialization affects affordability are starting to become more prevalent, what has not been explored as thoroughly are the systemic effects of financialization.  % Because of the significance of housing ownership to wealth distribution, the financialization of ownership may also affect the overall distribution of wealth. Fewer people are able to buy houses and those renting face higher rents and decreased ability to build wealth.
This thesis is a study of financialization in the context of housing markets. Specifically we explore the systemic effects of the shifting ownership of property in cities on the distribution of wealth and the capacities of cities to grow. We explore the effects of financialization on the distribution of wealth, as well as the potential that this shift can actually change the ability of cities to thrive and produce wealth. g

% financialization in the housing markets is a multi-faceted process that included the creation of financial instruments like mortgages and REITs and then the trading of these instruments of markets. %This process and it's effect on the housing market are very much contested at this time. 

\section{Space, cities, and financialization}

% There are two big transformations society is undergoing. 
We're concerned with the interaction of two historic processes that are changing society. 
One is continued urbanization, and the other is the process of financialization. %, which is just a feature of the capitalist system/expansion of capital. 
They are beginning to interact in the urban system. 
The reason is that city is productive, and financialization is all about capturing and owning the flow of surplus from any process.

% cities create value.

% exists land rent, and who gets the rents
There's a classical theory of who gets the product of land and how that affects the social classes.
%There's a theory of who gets te products of the productivy t of land provided by the classical economists.
There exist a neoclassical theory of production that explain who gets the products of labour and capital. There is also a spatial urban theory of where the land rents in cities are located. There isn't a theory of whose getting the rents that is actually a part of the productivity of the city. 

There's now a compelling understanding of the value that's created by cities, both empirically and theoretically \cite{jacobsEconomyCities1969, spenceUrbanizationGrowth2009, bettencourtIntroductionUrbanScience2021}, 
There is empirical evidence is that cities now produce most of the wealth of society. There's never been a rapidly developed urban city without growing productivity. That is well established empirically. 

People come to cities because of their productivity, but that means that they need places to live and they compete for those places, so land around the city and close to the city becomes valuable. That means that whoever owns the land can capture what are called \glspl{locational rent}. 

There's a gap, however, in the formal apparatus in standard economic theory for analyzing the distribution of the enormous value created. 
% What new models have done is produced a way of describing exactly where those rents are, but they haven't looked at who gets those rents, and that's very important because those rents are capturing some of the value/productivity of the city.

% that's being created. 
% ADD THE VALUE OF CITIES.  Cities create value. To analyze the distribution of the value created in the city, we develop the idea of spatial rent, and put it in a model with financializaiton of urban housing market.

% Financialization is an effort to claim these spatial rents.  There are models of rent in cities---it doesn't link with models of production and of finance.  Models of finance are spaceless.  In order to understand finacialization, and what the urban housing is doing doesn't connect with neoclassical models of production, or of banking and finance, not a link


% claim productivity,  - right to be productive in the city.. claiming the rents -the value in cities.. claim with financial instruments... once you have that in one model, you can actually do that link..  people think there is a return on investment,  what is it they're getting, it's a return on investment.

\section{Spatial urban rents}
% \section{Position in the literature}
This work draws together insights from urban economics, geography, and planning. A central, shared concern in all three fields is geographic space: locational value explains the dynamics of economic development, the spatial distribution of human activities, and urban form.  
In all three disciplines, locational value gives rise to land rents, which is for us the link to distribution, financialization, and continuing productivity.  

% spatial/locational rent is -"Income or payment for the use of location. Locational value is largely created by access to people not by landowners, hence any payment for locational advantages is a rent.
% land rent is "Ricardo payment for the natural productivity of the land, but also considered proximity to markets (locational advantages) as a source of rent. 
% ``The economic  surplus generated in production as a result of differences in the quality of some \gls{factor of production}. Often described as the difference between the opportunity cost of a factor of production and the income it earns. In this thesis we focus on rents generated by \glspl{agglomeration effect}. According to \gls{classical rent theory}, rent is the price paid for the use of land. More generally it is the  surplus generated by any natural resource, up to and including the athletic talents of basketball stars \cite{lackmanClassicalBaseModern1976}. Land, talent, and mineral resources are seen as ``the free gift of nature,'' forms of capital which the owners do not create but do appropriate. Like the productivity of agricultural land in classical theory,  urban \gls{agglomeration effect}s produce land rents that are not created but are appropriated by the landowners.''


% We begin in the region of overlap among the three disciplines with the fundamental linking construct, space. 
% All three fields have central theories built around the value of location, which is essentially the locational rents. 
Rent is a concept developed by classical economists like David Ricardo. WHAT IS IT? THEN WHY DOES CITIES NEED SPATIAL RENTS TO UNDERSTAND THEM...
Ricardo \cite{ricardoEssayInfluenceLow1815} elaborated the theory of land rents in 1815. Johann von Th\"unen \cite{vonthunenIsolirteStaatBeziehung1826} %(1783--1850) 
produced the first serious treatment of spatial economics and economic geography %, apparently independently 
in 1826. In 1961 William Alonzo (and others) \cite{alonsoModelUrbanLand1960} applied the  Ricardian and von Th\"unen theory to the urban system, launching modern urban theory. Meanwhile in economics, Solow \cite{solowContributionTheoryEconomic1956} set off a flood of work on economic growth that spilled into urban theory and connect with a rich body of work on economic development and the value created in cities including work by Jacobs \cite{jacobsEconomyCities1969}, Lucas \cite{lucasMechanicsEconomicDevelopment1988}, Bettencourt  \cite{bettencourtGrowthInnovationScaling2007}, and others. 
% *** growth doesnt feed into jacobs - fix.

Our contribution is to extend the the analysis of urban rents to take into account the effects of financialization. 
Standard models of the financial operations are spaceless. This means the standard models don't relate them to spatial rents.\footnote{In describing any theory we need to identify the kinds of objects that are theorized. Financial analysis theorizes  assets, debts, flows of revenue and costs, and the rates of change or exchange of these quantities over time. These are inherently spaceless because they are accounting entities, completely independent of location. It matters where a worker or a farm is. It does not matter where and dollar or a rouble is.}

This thesis focuses on the potential macro effects of financial capital capturing spatial urban rents.  % EXPLAIN WHAT THESE ARE
Our focus is on who captures these rents and how that affects the city. The distribution of locational rents, we believe, goes some distance to explaining core social issues like class structure, inequality, and political political power.  Figure~\ref{fig-fields} illustrated both the synthetic aspect of our analysis and the direction in which we develop existing work. % The organizing principle in the spatial models of all three disciplines is an economic variable, land rent, % The three disciplines share a simple economic insight.

The ultimate goal of this work is to develop a modern urban theory of rent, linking spatial rent, housing markets, and urban production. The following sections introduce how this work fits in the literature and the basic structure the core model, then list the main contribution, and give an outline for the thesis.


\section{Modelling the financialization of an urban housing market}
% We take a step beyond integrating labour markets in a city, to studying the distributional effects: who gets the surplus, what does that mean for the class structure, and ultimately the productivity of cities. 
In order to develop an analysis of the distributional effects we have to build a model with three components: a housing market that distributes income and housing, a financialization process, and a production system. 
% The first component, the market model, is illustrated in 
% Figure~\ref{fig-impacts} shows the main effects  that  arise from the growing financial sector participation in the housing market. 

Figure~\ref{fig-impacts} shows the first component, the market model.
It shows two primary effects financialization has on the housing market: how it allocates % The housing market allocates both 
the housing stock, and how it allocates the \glspl{rent} generated by the urban system. % as illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig-impacts}. PHRASE SO IT'S CLEAR THESE ARE EFFECTS 
% In the analysis developed in this thesis, % Our argument is that
The first effect of financialization, on housing allocation, arises because tenants replace owners. While owner-occupiers share in the growing land rents generated by urban agglomeration effects, tenants do not. As a result, a declining fraction of urban residents accumulate capital through their participation in the housing market, and therefore fewer enter the class of workers with both wage and capital income defined by John Roemer \cite{roemerGeneralTheoryExploitation1982}.

    \label{fig-financial-cycle}
    \caption[The financialization component of the model.]{The financialization component. There is a feedback loop in which new investors drive up demand and thus drive up prices.}
\end{figure}

The second effect of financialization on the market is in the allocation of rents. Rents generated by the agglomeration economies in the urban system are diverted to largely non-resident owners, away from investment in local production or amenities, as tenants replace owner-occupiers. % are gradually replaced by tenants. 

Figure~\ref{fig-financial-cycle} illustrates the second component of our model, the financialization process. We develop an explicit model of investor behaviour to explain the market decisions of buyers and the role of financial capital. 
The key observation is that investors enter the housing market. In doing so they drive up prices by increasing total demand. The rising price generates an expectation of capital gains, which enter the investors' calculations. Investors have, as research shows, better access to capital than most new entrants to the housing market. When the financial sector, represented by the bank, the figure, % in Figure~\ref{fig-financial-cycle}, 
makes more capital available, the pattern of ownership shifts, as illustrated above. % The theory of financialization is discussed in detail in Chapter ~\ref{chapter-financialization}.

\end{figure}

Figure~\ref{fig-alonzo-jacobs-cycle} illustrates the third component, the model of productivity incorporating agglomeration effects. %the productivity of cities, incorporates the productivity of cities.  
A fundamental feature in recent empirical work on scaling laws is % demonstrated in the recent literature on scaling laws: 
the persistent relationship between population and productivity. The productivity of cities increases superlinearly with population. Cities are the locus of a positive feedback loop with rising populations raising productivity, and rising productivity attracting more people and resources, a theoretical argument associated with the work of Jane Jacobs \cite{jacobsEconomyCities1969}, with strong empirical support from recent work on the scaling of urban productivity  \cite{bettencourtGrowthInnovationScaling2007, bettencourtOriginsScalingCities2013, dongUnderstandingMesoscopicScaling2020, loboUrbanScalingProduction2013}.

Our model brings together an urban spatial model with a model of the scaling of wealth in urban centers. %, using an approach similar to that developed in modern growth theory.
% that we discuss in Chapter~\ref{chapter-rent}. 
% In that chapter we ground the observation in  \gls{neoclassical growth theory} and recent empirical and theoretical work on \gls{urban scaling}. 
We incorporate that scaling result into the standard urban model, building of the work of William Alonzo and others. %associated with 
We call the combined model the\cite{alonzoTheoryUrbanLand1960}, calling the combined sub-model the 
\gls{Alonzo-Jacobs cycle} because there is a positive feedback between population size and wages. This feedback loop will be vulnerable if financialization extracts the new wealth generated by agglomeration effects, reducing wage growth and therefore the ability of the city to grow, because wage growth is what drives population growth and further agglomeration.
% We describe The Alonzo model in Chapter~\ref{chapter-space}.
The green boxes in the figure represent the theoretical justification of the primary simplifications in the model. 
% We call the combined sub-model the \gls{Alonzo-Jacobs model}, then combine that with an approach to the scaling of wealth based on the growth and agglomeration work in Chapter~\ref{chapter-growth}, on growth.

% When these components are  combined,  
Combining these three components, we have an extended theory of urban rent built on a foundation of theory that goes back to the \gls{classical economics} around the beginning of the 19$^{th}$ century and incorporating modern growth theory and modern urban theory. 

The resulting model suggests two basic hypotheses:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Financialization of the housing market will result in the tenantization of the urban middle class as financial capital acquires more of the housing stock. % vs decline of the urban middle class
    \item Financialization of the housing market will result in reduced growth of urban productivity as the flow of rents is diverted from real investment to the financial sector.
\end{enumerate} 

\section{Contributions}

The overall goal is to provide a theory of the relationship between financialization and urban productivity. The main contributions towards achieving this goal are:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item  Incorporating \gls{classical rent theory} into an \gls{agent-based} urban model. This requires modelling how \gls{Ricardian rent theory}, a theory of distribution based on an agricultural economy, applies % provides the transmission mechanism

    \item Allowing the creation and distribution of rents to influence urban growth, productivity and  population structure. This requires articulating the links between the wealth production of cities and how the urban system evolves.

    \item Incorporating current research on \gls{urban scaling} into the core spatial urban model.  This requires drawing on empirical work to formalise the scaling relationship, which embeds productivity in an urban model. % we argue is an elegant way to model a an urban system with production. % We show how understanding how complex systems scale provides an
