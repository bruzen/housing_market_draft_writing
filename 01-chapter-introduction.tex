Since the industrial revolution, widely distributed property ownership, particularly in North America, has contributed to the wide and relatively equal distribution of {wealth} \cite{pikettyCapitalTwentyfirstCentury2014, harrisGrowthHomeOwnership1977, chevanGrowthHomeOwnership1989, andrewsEvolutionHomeownershipRates2011}.\footnote{The role of housing in wealth accumulation is well known. After a detailed  examination of data from the US Survey of Consumer Finance (SCF) and the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID), Herbert et al. concluded that ``there continues to be strong support for the association between owning a home and accumulating wealth.'' The effect persists even among minorities and lower-income households. In lower-income minority households, on average, renters do not see any gains in wealth \cite{herbertHomeownershipStillEffective2013}.} However, property ownership is now going through a great transformation in structure, with financial capital coming to own a larger share of the urban land and housing stock \cite{farhaReportFinancializationHousing2017, palleyFinancializationWhatIt2007}. For the first time in Canadian history the rate of home ownership has declined, falling from 69\%  in 2011 to 66.5\% in 2021 \cite{statisticscanadaBuyRentHousing2022}. % BLACKSTONE
In Ontario, 70\% of new condo units are owned by investors not residents \cite{GET77percent}.

This process has been called financialization \cite{farhaReportFinancializationHousing2017, hansenFinanceCapitalismFinancialization2014, tomaskovic-deveyFinancializationCausesInequality2013, palleyFinancializationWhatIt2007, seccarecciaUnderstandingFinancializationHistory2013, nemtinFinancializationHousingSocial2021}. Financialization is one of two major transformations changing society. The other is urbanization. In this thesis, we are concerned with how these processes are beginning to interact. To explore this question, we have built a model of an urban system, to explore financialization in the context of housing markets. Specifically we explore the systemic effects of the shifting ownership of property in cities, on the distribution of wealth and the potential that this shift can actually change the ability of cities to grow, thrive, and produce wealth.

There's now a compelling understanding of the value that's created by cities, both empirically and theoretically \cite{jacobsEconomyCities1969, spenceUrbanizationGrowth2009, bettencourtIntroductionUrbanScience2021}. 
 It is well established that when people concentrate in cities, it increases productivity across a range of measures of output including GDP and GNP \cite{bettencourtIntroductionUrbanScience2021}. There's never been a rapidly developed urban city without growing productivity \cite{annezUrbanizationGrowthSetting2009}.  % In the language of cybernetics 
 There is a feedback loop\footnote{Work on feedback loops emerged largely as the result of WWII work on electronic and mechanical feedback controls for military purposes. Researchers across many fields %, organized around the emerging field of cybernetics, 
 quickly recognized that feedback mechanisms were a fundamental feature of systems and found examples in social science, engineering, biology, and brain science, among others. Enthusiasm for the concept was supported by a series of conferences supported by the Macy Foundation. % Cybernetics as a distinct field fragmented and faded. 
 Systems Dynamics, associated with Jay Forrester, and Systems Engineering emerged as more systematic offspring of this work.} %Cybernetics.} 
 between city growth and productivity. The effects of this relationship are so profound that cities now produce most of the wealth of society \cite{GET_cities-most-of-wealth}, and we build this feedback loop into our model.  

The city generates a surplus, and finacialization is about capturing surplus. Financialization of the housing market refers to the growth in the share of the housing stock controlled by financial institutions and investors and the overall effect this has on the outcomes of the system \cite{farhaReportFinancializationHousing2017, hansenFinanceCapitalismFinancialization2014}.% We model financialization as ***E CUT ALSO?? also a self-reinforcing feedback loop and link it through a model of the housing market to the productivity-growth feedback. 

%***E I FEEL LIKE THERE IS SOMETHING MISSING HERE. I THINK i GOT A BIT LOST IN THE PREVIOUS SENTENCE. MAYBE EXPLAINING WHAT MDELLING IT AS THIS FEEDBACK LOOK IS INTENDED TO REVEAL/WHAT IT DOES FOR UNDERSTANDING GRAWTH/CITIES/ OR WHATEVER. THEN TRANSITION TO NEXT PARAGRAPH WITH SOOMETHING LIKE: This set of issues is of more than theorectical interest.

Financialization is not neutral. It is increasingly associated with declining affordability and rising homelessness in Canada. These issues have become so extreme in recent years that Canada is now widely understood to be in a housing crisis. The Ontario Housing Affordability Task Force, for example, reported that home ownership is now ``beyond the reach of most first-time buyers across the province \dots Housing has become too expensive for rental units \dots The system is not working as it should.'' While discussions about whether and how financialization affects affordability are becoming more prevalent, what has not been explored as thoroughly are the systemic effects of financialization on ownership patterns and urban growth. Our model is an attempt to fill this gap.% ENCAMPMENTS

People come to cities for higher wages, amenities, and opportunities that arise because cities enhance overall productivity. New arrivals need places to live, so land close to the concentration of jobs becomes valuable. That means that whoever owns the land can charge for its use and capture what are called \glspl{locational rent}. Owning land is therefore a claim on the productivity of the city, just as owning agricultural land entitles the owner to the productivity of that land. %*E i FEEL IT WOULD BE USEFUL TO RESTATE THIS. IT SEEMS LIKE AN IMPORTANT CLAIM AND THIS IS A CLEAR AND DIRECT SRTICULATION BUT UNPACKING IT IN FOLLOW-UP SENTENCE MIGHT MAKE IT EASIER TO KNOW WHAT IT MEANS. eG: In other words... or that is to say....

In this thesis, to analyze the distribution of the value created in the city, we employ the idea of spatial rent, and put it into a model that allows for financialization of urban housing market. This work therefore draws together insights from urban economics, geography, and planning. A central, shared concern in all three fields is geographic space: in all three locational value gives rise to locational rents,\footnote{See Sprung-Keyser and Porter \cite{medina-olivaresJointModelLongitudinal2023} for a recent paper confirming that the is capitalized into land rents.}  explaining the dynamics of economic development, and the spatial distribution of human activities,  respectively. 

The concept of economic rent was developed by the classical economists of the late eighteenth and early nineteenth Centuries to explain how wealth was created and distributed in an agricultural society. David Ricardo \cite{ricardoEssayInfluenceLow1815} elaborated the theory of land rents in 1815. Johann von Th\"unen \cite{vonthunenIsolirteStaatBeziehung1826} produced the first serious treatment of spatial economics and economic geography in 1826. Much later, in 1961, William Alonso (and others) \cite{alonsoModelUrbanLand1960} applied the Ricardian and von Th\"unen theory to the urban system, launching modern urban theory. To model the distribution of locational rents in an urban system, we need to go back to the theory of rent developed by classical economists. This is a significant step because, while classical rent theory is the foundation for urban rent theory, the distributional aspects of the classical theory have not been applied.

As Alonzo and others were developing urban rent theory, Robert Solow \cite{solowContributionTheoryEconomic1956} developed modern growth theory, setting off a flood of work on economic growth that spilled into urban theory and connected with a rich body of work on economic development and the value created in cities, including work by Jacobs \cite{jacobsEconomyCities1969}, Lucas \cite{lucasMechanicsEconomicDevelopment1988}, Bettencourt \cite{bettencourtGrowthInnovationScaling2007}, and others. 
Neoclassical economic theory explains how the value of production is shared among the owners of various resources.  What has been missing is a detailed account of who gets the land rents in the modern urban system. 

Our contribution is to extend the analysis of urban rents to take into account the effects of financialization. Standard models of financial operations are spaceless. This means the standard models don't relate them to spatial rents.\footnote{In describing any theory we need to identify the kinds of objects that are theorized. Financial analysis theorizes assets, debts, flows of revenue and costs, and the rates of change or exchange of these quantities over time. These are inherently spaceless because they are accounting entities, completely independent of location. It matters where a worker or a farm is. It does not matter where and dollar or a rouble is.} Our solution is to explicitly embed the normally spaceless analysis of investment decisions in a spatial model with locational rents.

The model makes it possible to analyze the potential macro effects of financial capital capturing spatial urban rents. Our focus is on changes in who captures these rents, and how that affects the city. The distribution of locational rents, we believe, goes some distance to explaining core social issues like class structure, inequality, and political power.

The ultimate goal of this work is to develop a modern urban theory of rent, linking spatial rent, housing markets, and urban production. 
Figure~\ref{fig-fields} illustrated both the synthetic aspect of our analysis and the direction in which we develop existing work. The following sections introduce how this work fits in the literature and the basic structure of the core model, then list its main contributions, and give an outline for the thesis.

\begin{figure}[!ht]

\end{figure}


\section{Modelling financialization of urban housing markets}
In order to develop an analysis of the distributional effects we have to build a model with three components: a housing market, a financialization process, and a production system. The housing market sub-model  distributes the ownership of the housing stock that comes up for sale in each period to based on bids. % Both new entrants to the labour pool and financial investors can bid. If a new entrant fails to buy  housing that agent becomes a renter. 
The market determines the price for each unit. The price may depart from the market value of the services that each unit provides, providing the opportunity for speculative gains. Finally, the financial model determines the size of bids for investors based on the availability of capital and estimates of rental income and capital gains.


Our model therefore brings together three theoretical elements: an urban spatial model,  a model of the scaling of wealth in urban centers, and an income distribution model. %We incorporate that scaling result into the standard urban model, building of the work of William Alonso and others. 

We call the combined model %the\cite{alonsoTheoryUrbanLand1960}, calling the combined sub-model the \gls{Alonso-Jacobs cycle} because there is a positive feedback between population size and wages. This feedback loop will be vulnerable if financialization extracts the new wealth generated by agglomeration effects, reducing wage growth and therefore the ability of the city to grow, because wage growth is what drives population growth and further agglomeration. The green boxes in the figure represent the theoretical justification of the primary simplifications in the model. 

Figure~\ref{fig-impacts} shows the first component, the market model.
It shows two primary effects financialization has on the housing market: how it allocates
the housing stock, and how it allocates the \glspl{rent} generated by the urban system. 
The first effect of financialization, on housing allocation, arises because tenants replace owners. While owner-occupiers share in the growing land rents generated by urban agglomeration effects, tenants do not. As a result, a declining fraction of urban residents accumulate capital through their participation in the housing market, and therefore fewer enter the class of workers with both wage and capital income defined by John Roemer \cite{roemerGeneralTheoryExploitation1982}. 

The second effect of financialization on the market is in the allocation of spatial rents, generated in part by the growing productivity of cities. Rents generated by the \gls{agglomeration} economies in the urban system are diverted to largely non-resident owners, away from investment in local production or amenities, as tenants replace owner-occupiers.

\begin{figure}[!ht]
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=.70]{fig/flow-financialization.png}
\caption[The financialization component of the model.]{The financialization component. There is a feedback loop in which new investors drive up demand and thus drive up prices.}
\label{fig-financial-cycle}
\end{figure}

Figure~\ref{fig-financial-cycle} illustrates the second component of our model, the financialization process. We develop an explicit model of investor behaviour to explain the market decisions of buyers and the role of financial capital. The key observation is that investors enter the housing market. In doing so they drive up prices by increasing total demand. The rising price generates an expectation of capital gains, which enter the investors' calculations. Investors have, as research shows, better access to capital than most new entrants to the housing market. When the financial sector, the bank in the model, makes more capital available, the pattern of ownership shifts, as illustrated above.

Figure~\ref{fig-alonso-jacobs-cycle} illustrates the third component, the feedback between population and productivity. The green blocks represent the theory linking the relevant variables.  On the lower right, ``Scaling'' refers to the literature on agglomeration effects. On the upper right, neoclassical distribution theory provides a model linking productivity with wages.  On the left, the bid rent function links wages and population.

\caption[Production system.]{The production system component, incorporating the urban scaling of wealth in the urban spatial model. We name this coupling of two difference equations the Alonso-Jacobs cycle.}
\label{fig-alonso-jacobs-cycle}
\end{figure}

A fundamental feature in recent empirical work on scaling laws is the persistent relationship between population and productivity. The productivity of cities increases superlinearly with population. Cities are the locus of a positive feedback loop with rising populations raising productivity, and rising productivity attracting more people and resources, a theoretical argument associated with the work of Jane Jacobs \cite{jacobsEconomyCities1969}, with strong empirical support from recent work on the scaling of urban productivity  \cite{bettencourtGrowthInnovationScaling2007, bettencourtOriginsScalingCities2013, dongUnderstandingMesoscopicScaling2020, loboUrbanScalingProduction2013}.


Combining these three components, we have an extended theory of urban rent built on a foundation of theory that goes back to the \gls{classical economics} around the beginning of the 19$^{th}$ century and incorporating modern growth theory and modern urban theory. 

The resulting model suggests two basic hypotheses:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Financialization of the housing market will result in the tenantization of the urban middle class as financial capital acquires more of the housing stock. % vs decline of the urban middle class
    \item Financialization of the housing market will result in reduced growth of urban productivity as the flow of rents is diverted from real investment to the financial sector.
\end{enumerate} 
 
\section{Contributions}
The overall goal is to provide a theory of the relationship between financialization and urban productivity. The main contributions towards achieving this goal are:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item  Incorporating \gls{classical rent theory} into an \gls{agent-based} urban model. This requires modelling how \gls{Ricardian rent theory}, a theory of distribution based on an agricultural economy, applies in an economy driven by human capital \gls{agglomeration} effects within the urban system. 

    \item Allowing the creation and distribution of rents to influence urban growth, productivity and  population structure. This requires articulating the links between the wealth production of cities and how the urban system evolves.

    \item Incorporating current research on \gls{urban scaling} into the core spatial urban model.  This requires drawing on empirical work to formalise the scaling relationship, which embeds productivity in an urban model. 

    \item Constructing an urban \gls{agent-based model} that is consistent with {neoclassical growth theory}. We show how the neoclassical framework can be implemented in the agent-based framework, and make a case for the usefulness of the approach in linking urban rents and productivity. 

    \item Integrating \gls{financial capital} into a standard spatial model of the urban system, making an explicitly spatial model of the financial structures, which have traditionally been formalized in a spaceless way.
    
    \item Integrating financial capital into an \gls{overlapping generations} population model of the urban system and articulating the movement of financial capital though the urban land market. 
    
    \item Using an agent-based model to examine how financial markets impact urban \glspl{land market}, producing a formal simulation model that illustrates the process of housing financialization. 

    \item Testing for \gls{hysteresis} resulting from the business cycle in the urban system and exploring the \gls{resilience} implication's of the core spatial economic model.

    \item Building a model that can be easily extended to explore a range of issues, and used to evaluate policy options. The model combines clear and explicit theoretical assumptions with careful and transparent implementation of the logic. We have taken care to allow for both theoretical and policy-relevant extensions in the simulation,  building a base model that aims to be as simple as something like Alonso's urban model \cite{alonsoLocationLandUse1964}, but simulates the relevant system features and can incorporate a range of intervention types.
