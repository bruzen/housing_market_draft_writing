This thesis is a study of financialization in the context of housing markets.
One of the founding challenges of economics was explaining how wealth is created and distributed. Property ownership has  been a central form of wealth %one of central forms of  wealth and means of building wealth 
throughout history,  %ADD FACTS. 
and widely distributed property through home ownership has contributed to the wide distribution of wealth, particularly in North America\cite{pikettyCapitalTwentyfirstCentury2014}. % It is a key differentiator between who has built wealth and who hasn't. % ADD FACTS. %This is seen in the racial wealth gap, the immigrant wealth gap, and the youth wealth gap. 
Property ownership is going through a great transformation in structure, with financial capital coming to own a larger share of property,  particularly of urban land\cite{farhaReportFinancializationHousing2017, palleyFinancializationWhatIt2007}. %, is held by financial capital. 

% MORE IS OWNED BY FINANCIAL....
% One of the great transformations, is that financial capital owns a great deal more property. % xx in california, xx in Ontario, 70\% of new builds in Waterloo region. % Check

This process has been called financialization \cite{hansenFinanceCapitalismFinancialization2014, hansenFinanceCapitalismFinancialization2014}. 
Because of this significance of property to wealth distribution, the shift to financialized ownership % this shift %/this financiazation
has big effect for distribution.\cite{tomaskovic-deveyFinancializationCausesInequality2013, palleyFinancializationWhatIt2007, seccarecciaUnderstandingFinancializationHistory2013, nemtinFinancializationHousingSocial2021}. %This is accept SEEN IN XY say.  % \cite{nemtinFinancializationHousingSocial2021}, \cite{}

This thesis argues it may also have dramatic effects on the productivity of cities.

% In the next section, we describe the core model, then in following sections sketch the position this in the literature, describe the core contributions, and then outline how the document will develop these ideas.


\section{Financialization of Housing Markets}

 % in particular it's efect on productivity.
Financialization of the housing market refers to the growth in the share of the housing stock controlled by financial institutions and investors and the overall effect this has on the outcomes of system.
While financialization is usually understood as capital seeking profit, in the urban context it is a fundamentally spatial phenomenon. %also a spatial  phenomenon. 
% ***E MAYBE MOVE THIS UP... IT MIGHT BE HELPFUL CONTEXT FOR WHAT YOU ACTUALLY DO, IT BEGINS TO ESTABLISH THE PROBLEM
Its goal is the capture of spatial rents, which, we will show, has implications for both the productivity and the class structure of the city. 
 % These macro effects are our main interest. % While the term financialization can be used in a variety of ways,
The potential macro effects of capturing urban spatial rents are the specific concern of this thesis.  

These aspects of finacialization in the urban system have been neglected in the literature. Standard models of the financial operations are spaceless.\footnote{In describing any theory we need to identify the kinds of objects that are theorized. Financial analysis theorizes  assets, debts, flows of revenue and costs, and the rates of change or exchange of these quantities over time. These are inherently spaceless because they are accounting entities, completely independent of location. It matters where a worker or a farm is. It does not matter where and dollar or a rouble is.} 
Our solution is to explicitly link the largely spaceless analysis of investment decisions to spatial rents in an urban system. 

There's now compelling understanding of the value that's created by urban systems, empirically and theoretically, but there's no formal apparatus, in standard economic theory,  for understanding/analyzing the distribution of that enormous value that's being created. 

In order to develop an analysis of the distributional effects... we had to ....  

This thesis  is thus a contribution to developing a modern theory of urban rents.

\section{A model of financialization in urban housing markets}
We  develop a model for examining the relation between urban scaling and productivity with housing tenure linking production  and housing market. To do this, we needed to bring in a concept from classical economics, rent.  % ELABORATE ON THE MODEL

We develop a model which suggests two basic hypotheses:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Financialization of the housing market will result in the decline of the urban middle class and
    \item Financialization of the housing market will result in reduced growth of urban productivity.
\end{enumerate} 

% TODO: MAKE CLEARER. ADD  MORE CONTEXT ABOUT THE PROBLEM THIS THESIS IS TRYING TO FIX.
% Figure~\ref{Figure-impacts} shows the main effects  that  arise from the growing financial sector participation in the housing market. 
Figure \ref{Figure-impacts}, illustrates the two primary effects of financialization of the housing market, on how it allocates %The housing market allocates both 
the housing stock and how it allocates the land \glspl{rent} generated by the urban system. % as illustrated in Figure \ref{Figure-impacts}. PHRASE SO IT'S CLEAR THESE ARE EFFECTS 
In the analysis developed in this thesis, % Our argument is that
the first effect, on housing allocation, arises because the rents generated by the agglomeration economies in the urban system are diverted to largely non-resident owners and away from investment in local production or amenities. 

\begin{figure}[!ht]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[scale=.60]{fig/flow_impacts.png}
    \label{Figure-impacts}
\caption{Impacts.}
\end{figure}

The second effect, on the allocation of rents, arises because, with growing financialization of the housing market, owner-occupiers are gradually replaced by tenants.  Owner-occupiers share in the growing land rents generated by urban agglomeration effects, tenants do not. As a result, a declining fraction of urban residents accumulate capital through their participation in the housing market, and therefore fewer enter the class of workers with both wage and capital income. 

\begin{figure}[!ht]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[scale=.70]{fig/flow_financialization.png}
    \label{fig-financial-cycle}
    \caption{Financial capital}
\end{figure}


In the model, we explore these two effects with two sub-models.
% Behind the market process are two sub-models. 
The first sub-model, illustrated in Figure\ref{fig-financial-cycle},  develops an explicit model of investor behaviour to explain the market decisions of buyers and the role of financial capital. 
The key observation is that investors enter the housing market. In doing so they drive up prices by increasing total demand. The rising price generates an expectation of capital gains, which enter the investors' calculations. Investors have, as research shows, better access to capital than most new entrants to the housing market. When the financial sector, represented by the Bank, the figure, % in Figure\ref{fig-financial-cycle}, 
makes more capital available, the pattern of ownership shifts, as illustrated above. The theory of financialization is discussed in detail in Chapter~\ref{chapter-financialization}.

\begin{figure}[!ht]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[scale=.7]{fig/flow_Alonzo-Jacobs_cycle.png}
    \label{fig-Alonzo-Jacobs-cycle}
\caption{The Alonzo-Jacobs cycle.}
\end{figure}

The second sub-model, illustrated in Figure\ref{fig-Alonzo-Jacobs-cycle}, incorporates  productivity of cities. It brings together an urban spatial model with the scaling of wealth in urban centers, using an approach similar to that developed in modern growth theory.

To capture urban productivity, we introduce %rely on 
agglomeration effects, relating existing spatial and growth models to the scaling models from the study of complexity. A fundamental feature in recent empirical work on scaling laws is % demonstrated in the recent literature on scaling laws: 
the persistent relationship between population and productivity. The productivity of cities increases superlinearly with population. Cities are the locus of a positive feedback loop with rising populations raising productivity, and rising productivity attracting more people and resource. REDUNDANCY

Productivity scales with density in cities, throughout history, this is a strikingly consistent result, stretching even into prehistory. And cities don't die, they are notoriously hard to move.
Geoffrey West has argued that ``Cities are the crucible of civilization, the hubs of innovation, the engines of wealth creation and centers of power, the magnets that attract creative individuals, and the stimulant for ideas, growth, and innovation.'' \cite{westScaleUniversalLaws2017} CHECK SOURCE. This urban aglomeration effect, scaling with density of networks and urban vibrancy, is % of course
a theoretical argument associated with the work of Jane Jacobs \cite{jacobsEconomyCities1969}, although has strong theoretical and empirical support  \cite{bettencourtGrowthInnovationScaling2007, bettencourtOriginsScalingCities2013, dongUnderstandingMesoscopicScaling2020, loboUrbanScalingProduction2013} that we discuss in Chapter ~\ref{chapter-rent}. In that chapter we ground the observation in  \gls{neoclassical growth theory} and recent empirical and theoretical work on \gls{urban scaling}. We then incorporate that result into the standard urban model, building of the work of %associated with 
William Alonzo and others \cite{alonzoTheoryUrbanLand1960}.   We describe The Alonzo model in Chapter ~\ref{chapter-space}. We call the combined sub-model the \gls{Alonzo-Jacobs model}, then combine that with an approach to the scaling of wealth based on the growth and agglomeration work in Chapter \ref{chapter-growth}, on growth.

% MAYBE ADD MORE CONTEXT TO MAKE CLEARER
% When these components are  combined,  
Combining these components, we have an extended theory of urban rent built on a foundation of theory that goes back to the \gls{classical economics} around the beginning of the 19$^{th}$ century and incorporating modern growth theory and modern urban theory.


 % MOVE THIS TO SPACE?
%Missing- transfer of money vs put in a spatial framework.
%Most of the economic theory talks about where people go, and it doesn't talk about the value they create in the city and where that goes. That's finacialization, capturing those benefits is what capitalists are doing now.

% We see urbanization and continuing and financialization accelerating. Financialization is driven by capital seeking profits, but what is the source of the rents they capture? The answer is in conventional urban theory, which allows us to identify the spatial distribution of those rents and traditional rent theory, which allows us to understand the social relations of those, those rents, the classical economists spend a great deal of time on that question. And we're very clear about it.

%COMPELLING DESCRIPTION OF WHAT'S MISSING IN THE LITERATURE

\section{Position in the literature}

Our approach draws together insights from % economics and the study of cities. 
% Our model of the urban economy is based on work from those developed in 
geography, planning and urban economics. 
The organizing principle in the spatial models of all three disciplines is an economic variable, land rent, which is for us the link to distribution, financialization and continuing productivity. %*** (another sentence on why this is great) --The space-less quality of the study of finance leaves out xyz GET PHRASING- CAN'T SEE- INTEGRATION OF SPACE NEGLECT GROWTH FACTOR. 
Integrating classical and neoclassical economic approaches with traditional urban theory,  allows us to identify 
..we can build a more comprehensive model of financialization and its effects. This makes it possible to trace the spatial distribution of the rents.

Rent is important is all these traditions, but has been neglected in modern theory. We argue that to formally understand the processes behind financialization and the housing crisis, what's needed is a modern theory of urban rent. This thesis is a contribution to the development of that theory. REDUNDANCY?

Land rent was historically the basis of the wealth and political power of  the land-owning class in the era of the classical economists. % ***E NEED MORE HERE


We further link the model of urban rents to emerging concerns about the financialization of the housing market. The key insight we offer is that the financialization  of the housing sector is a  form of rent-seeking that must have detrimental effects on urban development and on the well-being of urban residents.


% ***E NEED TO POSITION THIS WORK IN RELATION TO THE MARGINALIST ACCOUNT IN THIS SECTION BECAUSE IT IS ONE OF THE FEW THINGS YOU HAVE INTRODUCES. tHE URBAN MODELS YOU DESCRIBE HERE SHOULD BE FRAMED BY WHAT YOU ADD IN BACKGROUND ABOUT PLANNING/URBAN MODELS (AS PER MY SUGGESTION IN THAT SECTION) 
% ***E YOU ALSO NEED TO ADD A SUMMARIZING PARAGRAPH WHICH I CAN HELP WRITE WHEN THIS SECTION IS MORE FILLED OUT. MAYBE THIS:
% ***E ADD: By bringing these approaches into a coherent approach, we can better account for  WHAT... EXPLAIN THAT alone they don't give as complete a picture. This thesis show that certain things become clear when they are brought together that provide an better account of the current situation. Older economics models do not predict certain things that are currently happening. This is because they are based on out of date modes of production, fail to account for the importance of location value and the modelling tools available when they were developed required some simplification.   Updating the models for the changing times, using more complex modelling systems and incorporating space with the economic models allow us to create models and narratives that provide a more effective understanding of the situation as it stands today.

% STORY? We began with what seemed like an obvious statement, and looked for a model to do it, found the modelling tradition was blind to precisely the questions we were trying to explore, surprized, explain why?
% MOVE? The challenge is to develop a simple conceptually clear model that can be extended and used in a wide range so that the tools for thinking about ownership can be integrated and used in analysis of a wide range of ideas using conventional economic theory.

The main contributions, as we see it, are:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item The core contribution is an exploration of the relationship between financialization and urban productivity. The basic relationship is established by incorporating \gls{classical rent theory} into an agent-based urban model. This requires a how \gls{Ricardian rent theory}, a theory of distribution based on an agricultural economy, applies in an economy driven by human capital \gls{agglomeration} effects within the urban system. 

    \item Allowing the creation and distribution of rents to influence urban growth, productivity and  population structure. This requires articulating the links between the wealth production of cities and  how urban systems evolve.

    \item Incorporating current research on \gls{urban scaling} into the core spatial urban model.  This requires drawing on empirical work to formalise the scaling relationship, which we argue is an
% We show how understanding how complex systems scale provides an 
elegant way to model a an urban system with production.

    \item Constructing an urban \gls{agent-based model} that is consistent with {neoclassical growth theory}.
% Although many  who employ ABMs to analyse urban systems are deeply skeptical of neoclassical assumptions
This demonstrates % in this context how %easily and productively 
how the neoclassical framework can be implemented in the agent-based framework, and make a case 
We case for the usefulness of an approach that link it's usefulness in linking urban rents and productivity, linking traditions that have been separate. 

In general, there is relatively little work rigorously linking analytic and agent based models, so the results can be understood formally, in relation. % incorporated into prior traditions and

    \item integrating \gls{financial capital} into a standard spatial model of the urban system

% We are not aware of any urban simulation models that
We introduce capital within this framework in a novel way. %as we do to examine the outcomes that concern us.
    
    \item integrating financial capital into an \gls{overlapping generations} population model of the urban system

Financial assets are central to most overlapping generations models. Our innovation is to articulate the movement of financial capital though the urban land market. 

SOMETHING LIKE Adding space to finance which has been spaceless.
    
    \item using an ABM to examine how financial markets impact  urban \glspl{land market}.

We began with with the fact that there is growing policy concern about the ``Financialization of  Housing''. We have produced a formal simulation model that illustrates the process. 

    \item testing for \gls{hysteresis} resulting from the business cycle   in the urban system, exploring the \gls{resilience} implication's of the core spatial economic model

There are two types of resilience questions when any system is shocked, does it return to an https://www.overleaf.com/project/606a6b286ae1c9f203fadab5equilibrium state - the stability question - and does it return to the same kind of equilibrium - the hysteresis question. We focus on the latter question.  

    \item building a model that is easily extended to explore a wide range of issues

The model combines clear and explicit theoretical assumptions with careful and transparent implementation of the logic in flexible Python code.

    \item providing a model that we believe can be used  to evaluate urban policies

To be useful in policy discussions, a model must correctly simulate the relevant system features and be able to incorporate a variety of policy interventions. We have taken care to allow for  both theoretical and policy- relevant extensions in the way the simulation model is coded.

\section{Document overview}
This thesis develops a conceptual framework for a model of the housing market and then describes the model and the implications of the analysis of the model. %insights it produces. 
There are three parts in the dissertation. 

MAYBE LINK ORDER TO POSITION IN THE LIT/CONTRIBTUIONS AGAIN % 3 PARTS TO THE MODEL, DEVELOPMENT FOLLOWS THE TRAJECTORY OF THIS. 

Part \ref{part-background} gives the background and introduces the theoretical framework for the analysis,  linking classical rent theory, neoclassical production theory, neoclassical growth theory, the scaling literature, and urban spatial models. 

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Chapter \ref{chapter-background} sketches how this thesis relates to four major fields: classical rent theory, neoclassical production theory and growth theory, the scaling literature, and urban spatial models. %..., and the role of space as a unifying factor across three of the fields. % WITH FINANCE IS SPACELESS.
    % *** ADD BACK? This work draws together sub-literatures including rent theory, production functions, the standard urban model, growth theory, urban growth theories, financialization, and the theory of distribution, so the chapters review those areas. % *** link the areas to the chapters better?  %theory for our analysis, 
    \item Chapter \ref{chapter-rent} reviews the literature on rent and develop an approach suited to the analysis for this work.
    \item Chapter \ref{chapter-growth} introduces growth theory, showing how our model is directly connected with this broad collection of linked theories. %, we use the Cobb-Douglas function, which is used across this entire range of literature - frame the relation of a tradition in context of  % After we develop the mathematical description of the relationship among these will discuss  in more detail, rent theory and our contribution, scaling laws, ......  and other issues in the literature that draw on parts of this model and % ???  apply to the specific situation we're in why rent theory is related to discussions of exploitation why it might lead the inefficiencies, whether or not this links with other important models in the literature.
    \item Chapter \ref{chapter-space} develops the urban model of space drawing on the basic Alonzo model.
    \item Finally Chapter \ref{chapter-financialization} provides a description of finacialization, and explores the potential consequences of fiancialization in the housing market.  % showing it is a form of rent-seeking in the housing market and ?? 
\end{enumerate}
 
Part \ref{part-model} develops the model and results.
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Chapter \ref{chapter-methodology} introduces the methodology. % In addition to the core contribution linking housing and productivity, there are three methodological lines of contribution, and there are policy implications SUMMARIZE METHODOLOGICAL CONTRIBUTIONS %(rent is key to financialization, however the main urban models don't observe the distribution of rents)
    \item Chapter \ref{chapter-model} describes an illustrative agent-based model of the urban system. 
    This model has three  parts, first a production function, modelling how urban regions generate wealth, and second a model of an urban housing market, and finally, a financial sector that can participate in the market. 
% Alternative phrasing 
%We integrate a labour market into a spatial urban model, set up to explore rent, and implications for the distribution of wealth.

\textbf{The model has a Solow-Swan style production model with agglomeration effects using a \gls{Cobb-Douglas} production function that incorporates Jacobs-style labour-augmenting agglomeration economies %(Beaudry and Schiauerova 2009, Panne 2004, J. Jacobs 1969), 
in the way neoclassical growth theory incorporates labour-augmenting technical change.}
It integrates the production function with an Alonso-style urban model of a city economy (Alonso 1964). 

We take a step beyond integrating labour markets in a city, to studying the distributional effects: who gets the surplus, what does that mean for the class structure, and ultimately the productivity of cities. 

This chapter introduce the urban spatial model and labour supply, models the production function with urban scaling of agglomeration effects with density, then introduces a model of financial investment/speculation into a spatially explicit land market model, then calculates profit, considers who gets the profit, and draws conclusions. 
 %calculate the urban surplus, and consider who gets it. 
 
% MOVE TO LIT REVIEW/CONTRIBUTION?
%: The work draws on the Alfonso/Von Thünen model of the concentric city and Dawn Parker and Filatova's work in agent-based modelling of housing markets (see http://jasss.soc.surrey.ac.uk/12/1/3.html 2009).% We begin with a simple model of a circular city with urban agglomeration effects. In subsequent sections we will use an agent-based model to relax assumptions to look at how the interaction between the production of social wealth in cities interacts with housing and the extraction of rent to drive patterns for individuals over space and time.
% Most of the analysis of urban systems has employed analytical models with roots that go back to von Thunen \cite{vonThunen} and more recently Alonzo \cite{ALONZO}. These models are extremely useful, but necessarily abstract from the concrete  and variable individual behaviour and  the details  of dynamics that make real cities path-dependent. XXX \cite{GET-Dawn} have shown that agent-based models can reproduce the features of the analytical models, at least in simple cases. TODO maybe divide chapter on theoretical core, followed by chapter on implementation (general for basic and resilience experiments).
    \item TODO experiment 1 - setup, parameter values,  analysis, and results
    \item Chapter \ref{chapter-resilience} develops a resilience analysis of the effects of a driven version of the model, introducing the pump effects.  
%Experiment 2 - setup, parameter values,  analysis, and results (TODO maybe introduce resilience ideas earlier so they are part of the mainline development, adding a resilience theory to part  \ref{chapter-background} after chapter \ref{chapter-financialization}.
\end{enumerate}

%  Finally Part \ref{part-system} puts the analysis %model %and theory 
% in the context of a larger system, using methods of systems analysis and design, to discusses potential interventions and policy implications.
% \begin{enumerate}
%     \item Chapter \ref{chapter-interventions} considers the system, examines the potential for a range of interventions, and identifies policy implications. % with a diagram relating interventions.
%     \item TODO chapters .. may analyze particular interventions/cases in more detail: e.g. shared ownership models e.g. acquisition/land trusts, developer models, tax/zoning, and funds/financing.
% \end{enumerate}

% After we develop the mathematical description of the relationship among these will discuss in more detail, various relevant applications, and issues in the literature that draw on parts of this model and apply to the specific situation we're in why rent theory is related to discussions of exploitation why it might lead the inefficiencies, whether or not this links with other important models in the literature.

% Because we draw on a wide range of methods and literatures, we discuss the relevant literature and  methodologies in the chapters where they apply 


CONCLUSIONS/SUMMARY?
We argue financialization %This dissertation makes the case that it
has worrying implications for the success of cities and the nature of our social fabric.
