The goal of this chapter is to describe informally the urban model that serves as a bridge from the growth theory we use to urban space and rent distribution.  Although the model is easily generalized, we restrict our presentation to the highly  stylized core version to establish how land rents are generated in the urban system and how they are related to neoclassical growth theory. We will go on in Chapter~\ref{chapter-financialization} to  introduce the  financial sector and land market.



\section{The Alonzo-Jacobs model}

We will refer to the core urban model developed by Alonso \cite{alonsoLocationLandUse1964}, Muth \cite{muthCitiesHousingSpatial1969} and Mills \cite{millsAggregativeModelResource1967}, and later formalised by Wheaton \cite{wheatonComparativeStaticAnalysis1974} and others, as the ``Alonzo Model.''\footnote{it is also called the Alonzo model, the Alonzo-Muth model, the Alonzo-Muth-Mills model, the circular city model, and the monocentric city model.} William Alonso published \textbf{Location and Land Use} in 1964  \cite{alonsoLocationLandUse1964} based on his 1960 Phd thesis,\cite{alonsoModelUrbanLand1960} 
giving him a slender priority in the literature.  Richard Muth's \cite{muthSpatialStructureHousing1961}, and \cite{muthRationalExpectationsTheory1961},  were written roughly simultaneously with and independently of Alonso's thesis, and  culminated in Muth's classic book, Cities and Housing  \cite{muthCitiesHousingSpatial1969}.\footnote{See ``William Alonzo, Richard Muth, Resources for  the Future, and the founding of urban economics''\cite{mcdonaldWilliamAlonsoRichard2007} for a more detailed discussion of the development of the model.}   It is worth noting that Lowdon Wingo also had a manuscript of  ``Transportation and Urban Land'' \cite{wingoTransportationUrbanLand1961}(1961)  in preparation that presented a core idea and  significantly influenced Muth \cite{mcdonaldWilliamAlonsoRichard2007}. Mills' ``Urban economics'' \cite{millsUrbanEconomics1972} followed soon after.

The  model  specifically linked the urban wage premium to urban land rents through transportation costs.  Bruckner \cite{bruecknerStructureUrbanEquilibria1987} describes it as ``a simple yet powerful model of urban spatial structure that successfully explains the principal regularities observed in the urban landscape,'' and goes on to say, ``the good predictive performance of the model suggests that its simplifications are artfully chosen, capturing the essential features of real-world cities''. It rapidly  became the central model in modern urban economics.

We use what we choose to call an \textbf{Alonzo-Jacobs model} to explore the source and distribution surplus value. The reference to  the agglomeration effects that Jane Jacobs  described in her great book, The Economy of Cities \cite{jacobsEconomyCities1969}. an that generate the  \gls{urban wage premium} central to urban growth. % and the wage premium. 

To situate the model further, recall that Ricardo had described a model with a central market for corn, producing corn took land and transporting corn to market was costly. Because there is one market price for corn, land with low transportation costs near the central market earns a rent.\footnote{In most of the discussion Ricardo emphasized  differential land fertility rather than distance to market.} More distant land has lower value. In Alonzo's model there is central market and a single price for labour, producing labour takes land, and transporting labour to the market is costly. Alonzo re-presents Ricardo's conception of rent  mathematically for a different social system and production technology.  

The logic of the model is illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig-alonzo-simple} for a city on a uniform plane with a population of identical workers who work at the city centre, have identical housing needs,  identical transportation costs and receive the same wage. Transportation to and from the center costs $\tau$ times the distance $d$ from the center. Fuel, capital, and time costs are  all included in $t$. The figure represents housing value and transportation cost at every point along the thin slice of the city from the centre to its edge at $d^*$.  It is common to assume that the labour market and production sector at the centre take no space. 

 Since individuals would simply move to any location that offered a higher utility, in an equilibrium all the otherwise identical workers must receive the same utility. This has to be the case even though those farther from the center must pay more for transportation to and from home. The variable that  adjusts to maintain equal utility with rising transportation spending is the cost of housing. Thiis conception of a locational equilibrium is the heart of the model and all its extensions.

The height of the green bar on the left illustrates the wage premium for urban labour at the centre of the  city. 
The height red triangle adjacent the green bar represents the amount of rent earned on land at the centre, which has no transportation costs. The entire red triangle is aggregate land rent generated by the city along the slice.\footnote{The model says nothing about who gets the rent in the urban economy. For classical economists it was obvious that the agricultural rents went to the class of land-owners.} Transportation to and from the center costs $t$ times the distance $d$ from the center. Fuel, capital, and time costs are  all included in $t$.

\end{figure}

The entire rectangle, $\omega$ $\times$ $d^*$, is the wage bill generated by urban agglomeration. Urban land rent is the residual when transport costs are deducted from the wage premium. It declines  with distance $d$ until, at the very edge of the city, $d^*$, the cost of transportation  consumes the entire wage ($td^*=\omega$). The grey triangle represents the amount of the surplus dissipated in travel costs.  Property values are simply the the present discounted value of the rent at any point.

At the bottom of the figure we illustrate the conventional `subsistence wage'  earned by a worker whether in the city or outside of the city.   In most analyses of urban spaces this living wage is simply ignored, since it is the wage premium that generates rents.  The relative size is unimportant because it is the same for urban and non-urban workers. If urban consumption is higher than non-urban consumption it must come out of the land rent.
%Workers are attracted to the city by the wage premium, $\omega$,  which represents the share of the surplus generated by the city that goes to labour.  
\footnote{If the city generates additional social amenities\index{amenities} not captured in the wage  the money available for housing does not change, although willingness to pay must be higher.  The  most likely adjustments are in urban `subsistence' and it is probably offset by rural amenity that is given up to live in the city. In the long run urban amenities must exert upward pressure on rural amenities. These interesting extension will not be taken up in this thesis. }

The extent  of the city  $d^*$ is a simply the distance at which total $rt$ transportation cost  is equal to the wage premium
\[d^* t= \omega\]
where $t$ is the unit cost of transportation. In the figure, $-t$ is the slope of the diagonal line dividing rent from transportation expenditure.



 \subsection{The magnitude of rents and transportation costs}
 From $w$, $t$ and population density we can derive population, wage bill, total rent, transportation costs. The figure above suggest that  half of the urban surplus is spent on transportation, but because the city is circular, the total value of rents can be represented as  a cone with the volume  \[ V=\frac{1}{3}\pi  d^{*2} \omega \]
of a cone with radius $d^*$ and  height $\omega = td^*$. Substituting out either  $\omega$ or  $d^*$, we find that total rent is  proportional to the \textbf{cube} of either  $d^*$ or $\omega$. 

The total value of wage payments appears as the volume of cylinder enclosing the cone\footnote{since the wage is the same for each unit of labour no matter where it resides.}.  
$V=\pi r^2 \omega$ 
and total transport costs are 
$\frac{2}{3}\pi  d^{*2} \omega).$
With uniform density, population is proportional to the square of  $d^{*2}$ while rents and  transportation costs are proportional to the cube. %move this?

\subsection{Net land rent} 
The simple graphical model we consider above is revealing, but it leaves out many important features of the urban system. The only costs included are the transportation costs for the individual.  Since urban services and  a substantial fraction of urban amenities are financed through the public sector a more complete model must include both servicing costs and property taxation. The relevant rent profile from an economic point of view is NET of all service costs. From a financial point of view, it is net of tax liabilities.% It would be interesting to produce a 3-D graph of the NET rents.

Two stylized facts should be noticed. The first is that the marginal cost of servicing generally  rises with the distance from the centre.  Figure
%~\ref{}
illustrates the general form of servicing costs, but not  the relative scales of rent and servicing costs. When this observation is combined with the `Henry George Theorem" () the conclusion is that the optimal size of the city  is at  $d^{**}$, where marginal service cost intersects with the marginal increase in total urban rent. 

The second stylized fact  is that property taxes, which are generally  fixed as a share of property value, decline as the distance from the centre increases. Figure %~\ref{} 
illustrates the general form of tax liabilities, although it does not  accurately represent their relationship to rent or  servicing costs.  This implies that in many or most urban situations the residents at the outer edges pay less than the average amount in property tax per unit of land, but cost  the community budget more than the average amount. In essence, the central city subsidizes the suburbs. (ref Perverse Cities)
This arrangement is both economically inefficient and unfair, but it has been built into the fiscal structure of cities largely as a result of automobile-based urban growth. It is likely that this fiscal misallocation saps some of the potential productivity growth of cities.

Property taxation reduces the market value of properties, but it also funds services and amenities that increase the value of properties. 

Both servicing and taxation effects are more variable and than the simple model suggests.  One  conclusion urban theorists draw based on variants of the Alonzo model is that because property owners in the low-density urban margin are subsidized,  the subsidy is likely to create serious fiscal problems for municipalities in the long term and result in serious inefficiency in land use. 



\section{Implications and results from Alonzo's  model}
Even with its brutal (or elegant) simplifications, the simple model  can  describe  many features of urban structure and urban history. In this section, we illustrate some of the insights supported by the model. Extensions can incorporate variations in wages, density, transportation costs,  preference, and even building technology and codes. The limitations of the simple, continuous, equilibrium-based versions described above can be overcome using agent-based models to model the evolution of complex and much more realistic urban systems. 



\subsection{Adding Jacobs-style agglomeration effects}
A device in this thesis is to focus on the urban wage premium that attracts workers to the city and pays their living and transportation costs. As we have argued above, there is a premium because of a variety of agglomeration effects that we do not specify that make urban labor more productive than non-urban labour. The process has very deep historical roots and we do not need to provide an origin story for our project. We do need to emphasize the self-reinforcing nature of the mechanism.

An increase in the productivity due to the various spillover effects discussed in the literature eventually is passed through, at least in part, to the wage. Conventional microeconomic theory can be brought to bear to provide a rough sketch the  complex process, which is generally slow, variable, and may involve many unsynchronized lags.  tghe basic process is thgat a firm, discovering its workers are  more productive than expected, enjoys unexpected output and profits. Since the marginal product of each worker is higher that expected, the firm  wants to hire more workers. To do so in a city with full employment, it must raise its wage offer. The increased wage attracts workers from other firms, putting pressure on them to also increase their wage. Wages rise across the city. The general increase in the wage attracts more workers to the city. 

The increase in wages appears at first as a benefit to workers as workers. The area in blue-green represents the worker's share of the increased productivity of the city. The increase is also translated with further lags into rising home prices across the city and rising rental prices for tenants.

Assuming that marginal and use per new resident is constant, city size will eventually increase in proportion to the increase in the wage, shown as the distance $d^*_0--d^*_1$. Aggregate rent  further expands by the area shown in orange. Population increases in proportion to the square of the increase in the wage, as illustrated with the blue line.  Output increases super-linearly with population, illustrated by the orange line. 

Adding to the  housing stock is a slow process, introducing potentially complex stock/stock-price dynamics.

The increase in population well eventually generate additional agglomeration benefits, further increasing wages. At the aggregate level this positive feedback appears to be solidly supported, but locally, within firms and between firms there will be long and variable lags. Analytical equilibrium models seek to bypass these messy processes, while agent-based models attempt to incorporate them.

\subsection{Differential transportation costs}
 Urbanists agree that before the railroad and the automobile, the extent of a city was roughly determined by how far a person could walk in about an hour. The time and effort cost of transportation determined the size of cities. 
 
 It also affected the distribution of the classes within the city. When everyone walked, the  wealthy may have valued their time more than the poor. In terms of the model, the willingness to pay for the rich would begin higher than it would for the poor, but would descend more rapidly with distance

 If the technology suddenly provides the rich with commuter trains or automobiles and more attractive sites at the edge of the city, the orange line could drop enough  and become much flatter leading in a flight of the rich to the suburbs, as appears to have happened in many American cities. Lower transportation costs make cheaper land on the

The transportation cost revolution brought about by the first street cars and later automobiles made much larger cities possible.  The average walking pace is 2.5 to 4 mph, and new transportation technologies raise this rate by a factor of between five and ten, increasing potential urban area by between twenty-five and one hundred times.   

% THIS IS INTERSTING K.  morgages: Effect of a finbancial instument on urban form!!  suburban flight, second half of the century

%Electric trolleys drew upon manufacturing technology that appeared only in the eighteen eighties and at first only in America. 

%As with other transportation revolutions, institutional as well as technological revolutions were necessary for the interurban phenomenon to succeed.  One such institutional revolution was the creation of the home mortgage in the eighteen eighties.  Another was the development of the public utility, a regulated monopoly, in the earlier twentieth. century.\footnote{https://faculty.washington.edu/jbs/itrans/charge20.htm} The automotive revolution was as important in its way as the coming of the railroads.

%The automobile in time established even more powerful synergies, but they weren’t present at the beginning.  Roads suitable for automobiles scarcely existed though new methods of paving utilizing macadam or concrete had recently been invented.  Furthermore, there was no good model in place for road construction.   Unlike the case with either light or heavy rail systems, the vehicles and the road itself were not part of the same corporate entity.       

%Once automotive ownership assumed certain proportions toward the close of the teens of the century, the automobile began to transform the landscape of America in an even more fundamental way than the streetcars had. 

%From the second decade of the twentieth century, the automobile in America has been linked with suburban flight, and when the growth of suburbs reached a crescendo early in the second half of the century, automobile ownership became the norm. 

% Because exurbs are already numerous and growing more so, they place considerable pressure on the Body Politic to ensure that fuel prices remain low, for if prices rise beyond a certain point the exurbanites will be forced to sell out, probably at ruinously low returns because few will choose to live in isolated areas without affordable transportation.  True, exurbs could conceivably be served by public transportation, but only at enormous cost per rider because the population densities are so low in the areas where they are located....

% That places the vast suburb dwelling public at risk and the exurbanites most of all.

Initially, rents fell at the centre and rose outside of the original city limits. Lower rents and cheaper suburban housing attract more workers, so that central rents and the land values they support  rise to the original levels and then, because the rising population makes the city more productive, beyond the original level. 

It  also affected social structure and left indelible marks on the form of cities developing at the time and after. In North America, with large amounts of land, it generated massive urban sprawl, but also made land available for a growing `middle class' of homeowners. This homeowning middle class became the dominant social formation in North 
American society. 

Ultimately the urban expansion generated congestion and rising transportation cost that began to limit urban growth, put upward pressure on  housing costs including transportation, and therefore downward pressure on middle-class effective incomes. Rising congestion costs steepen the rent profile and  reduce the net productivity of cities. Although the process is not a focus of this thesis it represents a relatively simple extension for later work.



\subsection{Class structure}\label{sec-class-structure}

At the stage illustrated on the right  in Figure~\ref{fig-rent-driving},  %(Alonzo city suburbanized with owner occupiers) 
as a result of rapidly rising productivity, falling transportation costs, and large amounts of land with relatively low productivity, a new urban social system has emerged with a land-owning working class. This is a recent phenomenon, and perhaps primarily a North American one. We are concerned in this thesis with whether it is also also be a passing stage.

America's economic transformation in the early 1800s was linked to dramatic changes in transportation networks. Construction of roads, canals, and railroads led to the expansion of markets, facilitated the movement of peoples, and altered the physical landscape. The later commuter transportation revolution  further transformed cities and class structures.

Belderbos et. al examine the simultaneous effects of spillovers due to research and development by universities and by firms \cite{belderbosWhatSpilloversUniversities2022}. Rising urban productivity in Japan are significant. 

%will raise the wage, attracting more workers. If they are added in suburbs at the edge of the city (Ricardo's extensive margin) virtually all of the wage premium they receive is dissipated in transportation costs. Closer to the centre,  land rents rise. Owner-occupiers capture the increase as property value appreciation. Tenants are likely to be faced with higher rents.      

%If agglomeration is the source of productivity gains, however, the new workers increase the urban premium, further increasing land values and attracting more workers. 

%The rural population consists of uniformly distributed efficient mix of rural capital producers and workers, all of whom receive $\omega$.%\footnote{This does nothing but fix the price of produced capital in terms of the rural wage.} 

 %Owners of urban firms are  conventional  capitalists, who may earn excess profit if they can capture an unearned surplus from labour.  Any unearned surplus increases the return to urban capital relative to rural capital, resulting in continual expansion of the urban economy. Continuous growth in turn results in continuously rising urban land prices and hence housing costs. We ignore the distributional implications of this feature of the model, and focus instead on the part of value produced by the city that appears as land rent. 

In this chapter we have described a very abstract, stylized model to establish how land rents are generated in the urban system and how they are related to neoclassical growth theory. One feature of this model is that none of the simplifying assumptions are essential. The mode can easily be generalized in many ways. We maintain the basic simplicity but..
