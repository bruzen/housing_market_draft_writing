\chapter{Conclusion} \label{chapter-conclusions}


% INTRODUCE 1. WEALTH AND VALUE IS CREATED IN CITIES THROUGH the productivity of cities AND 2. PROPERTY IN HOUSE OWNERSHIP IS IMPORTANT TO DISTRIBUTION OF WEALTH.
%And ownership oofo the land and properties in cities is important to how that wealth is distributed.
We set out to determine whether financialization is likely to  shift the ownership of property in cities away from residents, affect the distribution of resources and change the ability of cities to grow, thrive, and produce wealth. 
% This work presents a model that allows us to explore the financialization of urban housing markets. 
We have produced a theoretical simulation that suggests that financialization of the housing market may indeed have worrying implications for the success of cities and the nature of our social fabric. 

Financialization expands financial ownership and tenancy, while reducing the share of owner-occupied housing. Its goal is the capture of spatial rents, which is fundamentally nonproductive \gls{rent-seeking}, meaning that it does not contribute to the production sector or to the wealth of city residents. 
It could, if it follows the pattern in the model, progress to the point where owner-occupiers are entirely squeezed out of the city. Currently home ownership in Canada exceeds 60\%, but that number is falling. 
% and our model suggest that it will continue to fall. 
If it continues to fall, the resulting tenantization would radically change Canadian social structure and have a profound negative impact on the distribution of wealth. Our analysis raises the question of whether Canadian cities, given the current housing crisis and the progression of financialization, can continue to attract people and accumulate wealth for residents and industries.

We also explore the possibility that financialization of the housing market may spill over to urban productivity, reducing urban growth and the urban wage. This is a worrying prospect, given the continued urbanization of the Canadian population and the widespread concern about falling Canadian productivity. We have identified a number of potential channels  for such spillover and suggest that identifying which, if any, are active should be high on the national % social-science
research agenda.

The purpose of our model is \gls{theoretical exposition}. It tells us about the relationship between variables in the model.  It makes no claims about the world outside the model, however it can suggest questions or directions for empirical work. With simple extensions and calibration the model is capable of generating testable empirical hypotheses on furthur policy issues.  % is a flow of money into the housing market but not into housing production, 

Contributions from this work, include that the model: 
\begin{enumerate}
    \item  Incorporates \gls{classical rent theory} into an \gls{agent-based} urban model. 
    
    \item Allows the creation and distribution of rents to influence urban growth. 
    
    \item Incorporates current research on \gls{urban scaling} into an explicitly spatial framework.
    
    \item Integrates an urban \gls{agent-based model} with {neoclassical growth theory}. 
    
    \item Integrates \gls{financial capital} into a standard spatial model.
    
    \item Integrates financial capital into an \gls{overlapping generations} population model of the urban system.
    
    \item Uses an agent-based model to examine how financial markets impact an urban \gls{land market}. 

    \item Can be easily extended to explore a range of issues and used to evaluate policy options. 
\end{enumerate}
To summarize, we have built a simulation model linking theories across economics, finance, and urban theory that allowed us to contribute to the understanding of how financialization interacts with housing allocations and productivity. The model is extensible and has been designed to support trans-disciplinary collaborative research in an under-studied but important policy area. It is also suitable for use as a teaching tool. The simulation code is structured to make experiments easy and fast. We hope to develop an interface that will make experimentation even easier.

We have also provided a careful exposition of the theoretical work from several fields and periods that form the basis of our modelling. Our synthesis is new, and we hope, illuminating for others working on urban economics and housing policy.


As financial actors buy up more of the property near cities, it can affect both distribution and the capacity of cities to build human capital and create value. 


% and ownership of the land and properties in cities is important to how that wealth is distributed.

% % We have used what we call the  \textbf{\gls{Alonso-Jacobs model}} to explore the source and distribution surplus value. We  work with an extension of the basic Alonso model that incorporates the \glspl{agglomeration effect} that Jane Jacobs  described in her book, The Economy of Cities \cite{jacobsEconomyCities1969}. In our model these effects generate the \gls{urban wage premium} central to urban growth. % and the wage premium. 

% % The result is a simple model in which marginal productivity determines the wage, the wage determines the size of the city, the size of the city determines the labour supply, and labour supply determines marginal productivity. 

% % The economics is clear that this is what's at stake is productivity of cities, the distributive features of the economy and the impact of the middle class. 
% % Highlights the urgent need for more empirical work.

% % WAS AT END OF SPACE CHAPTER 
% EXPLAIN THE CONTRIBUTION MORE CLEARLY
% Other theories of space and transportation costs  don't examine distribution or how the distribution of rents might affect the productivity of the city, which means they throw no light on the effects of the financialization of the property market on distribution or on urban productivity.  This is the limitation we seek to address in this thesis. 

% We build the  standard urban model into our model of financialization by using the concept of rent as it appears in the urban system


% We explore distributional consequences, how the distribution of rents feeds back into the productivity of cities, and how the urban economy is changed by the financialization of urban housing. % and relating them to neoclassical growth theory.  
% % % This chapter introduces the background to the theory of the urban model. 
% % E ADDED: 
% By combining these pieces we can look at how ownership changes with finalization, how that can feedback into changing the process of value creation in the urban center.
% % Rent provides a  neglected indicator or state variable in the urban system. It can be  seen as an indicator of the state of teh system that has been largely neglected.
