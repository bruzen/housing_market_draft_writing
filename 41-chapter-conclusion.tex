%INTRODUCE 1. WEALTH AND VALUE IS CREATED IN CITIES THROUGH the productivity of cities AND 2. PROPERTY IN HOUSE OWNERSHIP IS IMPORTANT TO DISTRIBUTION OF WEALTH.
%And ownership oofo the land and properties in cities is important to how that wealth is distributed.

PAST TENSE

Cities drive the creation of value.
%Cities are at the heart of how people create value. 
There's a gap, however, in the formal apparatus in standard economic theory for analyzing the distribution of the enormous value created in cities. 

Since the industrial revolution, widespread property ownership  has been pivotal in driving an unusually equitable distribution of wealth, particularly in North America. However, a seismic shift is now reshaping property ownership, with financial capital increasingly dominating urban real estate landscapes. This dissertation has explored the distributional and productivity impacts of that shift, given the central role of cities in the economy. In particular, we have explored the hypothesis that financialization induces a shift towards tenancy among the urban workforce and the possibility that redirecting spatial rents results in decreased urban productivity. 

Financialization of the housing market %is a flow of money into the housing market but not into housing production, 
expands financial ownership and tenancy, while reducing the share of owner-occupied housing. Its goal is the capture of spatial rents, which we show has implications for both the productivity and the class structure of the city. 
In the urban context, financialization is fundamentally \gls{rent-seeking}, and we show it can have a profound impact on the system, including effects on both distribution and productivity. 


We argue financialization %This dissertation makes the case that it
has worrying implications for the success of cities and the nature of our social fabric. 
The housing crisis raises the question of whether Canadian cities can continue to attract people and accumulate wealth for its residents and industries, and whether they can sustain their growth.
A key insight is that the financialization of the housing sector is a form of \gls{rent-seeking} that must have detrimental effects on urban development and on the well-being of urban residents, that is neither constructive nor productive.


This work brings together \gls{neoclassical growth theory} and recent empirical and theoretical work on \gls{urban scaling} to build a model of an urban system to explore financialization in the context of housing markets and we explored the systemic effects of the shifting ownership of property in cities on the distribution of wealth and the potential that this shift can actually change the ability of cities to grow, thrive, and produce wealth.

% We have used what we call the  \textbf{\gls{Alonso-Jacobs model}} to explore the source and distribution surplus value. We  work with an extension of the basic Alonso model that incorporates the \glspl{agglomeration effect} that Jane Jacobs  described in her book, The Economy of Cities \cite{jacobsEconomyCities1969}. In our model these effects generate the \gls{urban wage premium} central to urban growth. % and the wage premium. 

% The result is a simple model in which marginal productivity determines the wage, the wage determines the size of the city, the size of the city determines the labour supply, and labour supply determines marginal productivity. 

% The economics is clear that this is what's at stake is productivity of cities, the distributive features of the economy and the impact of the middle class. 
% Highlights the urgent need for more empirical work.


% Particularly, it centers concern with implication for urban development of growing rent extraction by the financial sector. 
% Our focus is land rents, %but in the context of an urban economy. 


% This appears, at least part of it appears as locational rents. 
% Financialization, is about capturing the surplus generated by the city.  % To model the financialization of land markets.

% To model financialization we need rent because
% To develop a formal model of financialized urban land markets, we introduce rent because rent is % precisely   about extracting and allocating surplus value in a system. % and that is what financialization of the housing market is about/does. 
% The classical approach to rent is a core tool in the development because it brings the extraction of surplus into focus.
% GAP Nobody has linked the rents - linking rents to urban scaling. Beteencourt is talkign about a surplus in the system, wealth, but he hasn't linked to the market/land market for those locational rents.

% WAS AT END OF SPACE CHAPTER 
EXPLAIN THE CONTRIBUTION MORE CLEARLY
Other theories of space and transportation costs  don't examine distribution or how the distribution of rents might affect the productivity of the city, which means they throw no light on the effects of the financialization of the property market on distribution or on urban productivity.  This is the limitation we seek to address in this thesis. 

We build the  standard urban model into our model of financialization by using the concept of rent as it appears in the urban system


We explore distributional consequences, how the distribution of rents feeds back into the productivity of cities, and how the urban economy is changed by the financialization of urban housing. % and relating them to neoclassical growth theory.  
% % This chapter introduces the background to the theory of the urban model. 
% E ADDED: 
By combining these pieces we can look at how ownership changes with finalization, how that can feedback into changing the process of value creation in the urban center.
% Rent provides a  neglected indicator or state variable in the urban system. It can be  seen as an indicator of the state of teh system that has been largely neglected.

% The 3 parts of this do xyz
% The dissertation is organized into three parts: background, methodology, and analysis. The background section provides theoretical foundations and reviews relevant literature, while the methodology section outlines the model framework. The analysis section presents results from simulations and discusses their implications.

% Firms hire workers if it is profitable. Firm productivity and wages rise with population due to agglomeration effects. 

% Rural workers near the city apply for urban jobs if the urban wage justifies travelling to the city center to work.

 %in a %spatially explicit urban land market. 
The most complex part of the model is the financial bidding for property by different agents. Firm technology and the price of output are held constant. Investors represent the supply of global capita and are by assumption non-resident.

It also allows us to see how the locational rents generated by the city is distributed between investors or residents.  % This paragraph says that results emerge from the interaction of independent agents./
 % is captured through land rents. 
By capturing rents, financialized actors are able to capture a share of urban productivity.  
In the model, this affected the systemic effects of the shifting ownership of property in cities on the distribution of wealth and the potential that this shift can actually change the ability of cities to grow, thrive, and produce wealth. 
% Big chunks simplified but the guts are in financial behaviour. 

% It is helpful for economic policy in complex environment. 
The model allows us to test qualitative effects of various policies.
