The economics is clear that this is what's at stake is productivity of cities, the distributive features of the economy and the impact of the middle class.


Adding 2 things 1. rent extraction and 2. power law scaling of productivity, we find rent is the breaks on the engine of wealth creation


%Strikingly, Ricardo concluded\footnote{An Essay on the Influence of a low Price of Corn} that, “It follows then, that the interest of the landlord is always opposed to the interest of every other class in the community.” Rents approriated by the land owner are not available to the worker  or the capitalist for re-investment. This is a view that Henry George would later pick up and it is one that we return to in our study, since the issue of urban rents is of great policy importance.
