The two main hypotheses of this thesis are, first, that the financial sector affects the ownership of housing and the class structure of society, and second that this may have implications for urban productivity. To explore the impact of financialization on productivity we will introduce explicit links between ownership and productivity in Chapter~\ref{chapter-tramsmission}

We begin with the first hypothesis. The section of the model that we call the produces demand for land. In the housing market section land agents bid for land. Competition between would-be owner-occupiers and investors results in an evolving allocation of ownership of land. The ownership pattern determines the distribution of the locational rents generated by the city.
