\section{Financialization and urban land rents}
%BASED ON Financialization_of_the_Housing_Market.tex

Financialization is the process by which financial institutions, markets, etc., increase in size and influence. More specifically it is the process by which future streams of revenue and speculative gains are systematically captured by individuals and institutions with financial assets. Financialization of the housing market is the increasing control of the stock of urban land and housing in order to capture the scarcity rent generated by the people of the city.  

Mortgages, for example, are a financial instrument that allows lenders to  participate in housing purchases in the present in exchange for a future flow of payments.  The mortgage does not create housing, but it enables the prospective buyer to become the nominal owner of an asset that produces a stream of benefits. The stream of benefits from secure housing near a source of income generally greatly exceeds a buyer's current assets. The mortgage enables the  transfer of ownership because it makes it possible to transfer the rights to a substantial fraction of the future income of the buyer to the mortgage holder who then, in effect, is the actual owner until the terms of the mortgage are fulfilled.  If the mortgagee fails make those payments the mortgage holder  takes over the asset. 

About 80\% of Canadian homes are owner-occupied and about a third of the  value of the homes is held as mortgages. Approximately two-thirds of the net land rents associated with housing therefore accrue to owner occupiers. {\color {red}CHECK THESE NUMBERS }

The mortgage demonstrates the two aspects of financial instruments. It is both a financial instrument that enables a purchase and a financial asset that can be bought and sold. When we consider urban housing, it is the right to future income generated by capital, labour and the the city itself through the agglomeration effects that drive productivity. It is an instrument that indirectly captures a share of the urban rents. As productivity rises, wages rise, rents rise, property prices rise and mortgages rise. 


For an example of a financial instrument designed specifically to support rent extraction and which  increases the degree of financialization of the housing supply  real estate investment trusts (REIT). A REIT is a company that owns, operates, or finances income-generating real estate and distribute the income to shareholders. Modeled after mutual funds, REITs pool the capital of numerous investors. REITs that develop new properties generally don't sell the properties they construct.

Developed in the USA  in 1960 (as an amendment to the Cigar Excise Tax Extension.) and in Canada in 1993, REITS allow investors to buy shares in commercial real estate portfolios without having to buy, manage, or finance any properties themselves. This makes it possible for individual investors to earn dividends from real estate investments.  

REITs have become an attractive instrument for investment, in part because they have outperfomed the market. An S\&P-Dow Jones research bulletin reported that over the  25 years to 2017, REITs outperformed stocks, bonds and commodities. 

They are not simply a neutral tool for saving however. 
According to a paper\footnote{ Guolin Wang. Analyze the Impact of REITs on the Irish Real Estate Market. Advances in Economics, Business and Management Research, volume 203, Proceedings of the 2021 3rd International Conference on Economic Management and Cultural Industry (ICEMCI 2021)} on REITS in the Irish housing market,``REIT successfully reconnected the international financial market and the Irish real estate market. '' `` the large-scale acquisition of Irish real estate by REITs and other real estate buyers has also caused some new problems. First, the active management of assets by REITs and other investors has led to a rapid increase in rents. ''. 

There is evidence that they realestyate markets in other ways. A \href{https://www.ineteconomics.org/research/research-papers/the-role-of-public-reits-in-financialization-and-industry-restructuring}{report} from the Institute for New Economic Thinking,, for example argues that ``The evidence in this report shows that they are actually financial actors that aggressively buy up property assets and manage them to extract wealth at taxpayers’ expense. ''\footnote{The Role of Public REITs in Financialization and Industry Restructuring. Rosemary Batt and Eileen Appelbaum, with Tamar Katz* Working Paper No. 189 July 9th, 2022} ``hey have expanded the pool of capital available for transactions that monetize real property and turn it into tradable assets – financial widgets with little or no connection to the real purpose of the productive enterprises that occupy the properties they own.''



For urban theory and policy formation it is important to distinguish between financial instruments that enable production of real assets and instruments like the mortgage that primarily facilitate the transfer of real assets or rights to real estate  income. Housing developers borrow to purchase land for development and builders borrow to finance construction. While important, the financial instruments involved are not driving the financialization of housing.  The size of the loans involved is affected by the amount of land purchased and the potential rents earned by that land, the degree of non-occupant ownership is not affected.


When  a productive asset is acquired as a financial asset it remans productive. African land or land in Northern Ontario acquired by holding companies may even be made more productive. 
T%he goal of such investments, however, is generally to achieve a capital gain over time. Financial analysis is essentially about rates of return on financial capital invested. The opportunity for capital gains  attracts financial capital to the housing market.%Financial managers have no interest is n in assets that are not expected to increase in value.

Financialization of urban housing benefits  a globally distributed rentier class of urban landholders. We will make this more explicit below the incentive structure deriving the further financialization of the housing market.

\section{Literature on theory and evidence}
{\color{red}There is substantial evidence that the financialization of urban housing is underway in Canadain cities

PROVIDE EVIDENCE 	mention theories?}


Two questions arise when we observe growing participation of global capital in the urban housing system: 
\begin{enumerate}
\item How far will the financialization of urban land go? 
\item That are the implications for the urban economy and the welfare of the urban population? 
\end{enumerate}

We can demonstrate  that  in the absence of policy interventions, differential access to finance capital ensures that capital owners acquire an increasing share of urban land over time and capture the growing  land rents  from urban productivity growth. Growing wealth inequality emerges within a simple, widely accepted model of the urban land market. In the limit,  urban residents are tenants, and new residents  without capital do  not receive any of the increases in rents arising from the growing productivity of the city. 

%The first question therefore is reduced to which capital holders will increase their share of urban land and whether there is any reason to expect the process of financialization process to stop or reverse itself.

\section{The rate of return on a property purchase}


ADD TABLE WITH VARIABLE DEFINITIONS
 
 In this section we develop a model of the return to investment in urban housing/land. We'll assume that all agents are speculating on potential capital gains as well as on the use values they get from a property.  We will also assume that the use value is captured by the stream of rental values, whether a home is owner occupied or  held by an investor as a financial asset. To keep the analysis simple without loss of generality we will consider a one-period investment.
 
 The speculator  invests a down payment, $D$, and gets back at time $T$ the  increased price $(1+\dot p)P_0$, plus rents, minus any costs and minus the mortgage with interest.\footnote{We have applied this model to explore the effect of a vacancy tax in Beirut.  Fort that analysis we  added a use-value, $U$ in place of rent for expatriate owners to represent using the property - say one month a year - when they are not renting the property and a \textbf{vacancy tax}, $T$ at rate $t$ to affect the speculator's  decision. \cite{Al-Shihabi}}


\begin{eqnarray*}
V  	&=& capital\ gain - Interest\ due  	+ Rent  - operating\ cost -taxes\\
% 	&=& \delta P_T-D \qquad \qquad \quad - (1+\delta r)M \quad	 + R  	-C\\
% 	&=& \delta P _T \qquad-(P_0-M) \quad- (1+\delta r)M 	 + R  	-C\\
%	&=& \delta (1+\dot p)  P_0 -(P_O -M)  -(1+\delta r)mP_0  + R  -C\\
%	&=& \delta (1+\dot p)  P_0 -P_O + M \qquad -(1+\delta r)mP_0  + R -C\\
%	&=&( \delta (1+\dot p)-1)  P_0  + mP_0 \quad -(1+ \delta r)mP_0  + (\rho-\kappa)P_0\\	
%	&=& \left(  \delta (1+\dot p)-1    + m \quad - m(1+\delta r)  + (\rho-\kappa)\right)P_0\\'
%	&=& \left(  \delta (1+\dot p)-1    + m \quad - m-\delta rm  + (\rho-\kappa)\right)P_0\\
&=& \delta(P_T- (1+r)M) \qquad \qquad 	 + R  	-C   - T\\
&=& \delta((1+\dot p)  P_0- (1+r)mP_0)   + \rho P_0  	-\kappa P_0 - tP_0\\
&=&( \delta((1+\dot p)  - (1+r)m) \ + \rho   	-\kappa -t) P_0
\end{eqnarray*}

This is the  net present value of buying, and selling after one period. It has  6 exogenous parameters, $\delta, \dot p, r, m, \rho, \kappa$ and $t$.   Operating revenue and costs $\rho, \kappa$ and $t$ are expressed as  present values. Both the  share of the price  that can be mortgaged, $m$, and the interest rate  and $r$ are functions of the agent's wealth. $\delta$ may be correlated with wealth as well. 

The rate of return $v$ is the value of the gain, $V$, divided by  the size of the downpayment, $D$. 
%The rate of return is $v = \frac{V}{D}$. %For expat investors, we get a \textbf{decision rule}:\begin{enumerate}
%\item  if $v \geq a$ (with some private use?) with no rent,  don't bother renting. 
%\item If $v(no\ rent\ and\ tax) < a\geq v(with\ rent)$,  then  rent. 
%\item If $ v(with\ rent) \le a $,  then sell 
%\end{enumerate}\
\begin{eqnarray}
v&=&( \delta((1+\dot p)  - (1+r)m) \ + \rho   	-\kappa - t ) \frac{P_0}{D}   \nonumber\\
		&=&( \delta((1+\dot p)  - (1+r)m) \ + \rho   	-\kappa - t ) \frac{P_0}{P_0-mP_0}   \nonumber\\
		&=&\frac{ \delta(1+\dot p  - (1+r)m) \ + \rho   	-\kappa - t } {1-m} \label{Eqn:DecisionRule}
\end{eqnarray}

%\begin{enumerate}
%
%\item  the buyer and seller calculate the value of the property  differently. 
%
%\item  the  buyer and seller may have different expectations of the path of prices and therefore the stream of rents.
%%There are two standard ways that expectations are modelled
%%	\begin{enumerate}
%%	\item \textbf{Adaptive expectations.} Expectations are largely based on what has happened in the past. 
%%	Under normal conditions most people people have relatively weak incentive to get forecasts about inflation correct, and lack the resources and time to purchase expert advice. 
%%	Recent price trends are easily available and likely to be the main source of  information.
%%	\item     \textbf{Rational expectations.} Expectations are based on a model of the future economy. 
%%International investors and banks employ economists and other experts to  forecast prices, exchange rates, and trends in the economy.
%%	\end{enumerate} 
%\end{enumerate}
% Why would  discount rates differ between identical workers? Buyers and sellers are not identical in wealth, obviously. 
%%We could implement the first  explanation either by generating expectational errors based on functional class or wealth. 

%As expected
%\begin{enumerate}
%\item A large $m$ magnifies the return. (downpayment is smaller)
%\item A lower mortgage interest rate increases the return because of interest on the mortgage
%\item A lower discount rate $\delta$ reduces the subjective rate of return
%\item Higher expected price appreciation increases the attractiveness of investment
%\item Higher rents makes the unit more profitable if rents are being collected
%\item Lower costs increase profits
%\item Lower tax rates decrease holding costs and increase the value of the investment
%\end{enumerate}
The implications of Equation~\ref{Eqn:DecisionRule} are significant for the evolution of the urban land market and class structure. They suggest strongly that large wealth-holders will get higher expected and actual rates of return on land than those with  lower wealth holdings,\footnote{Case and Schiller ``%The ratio of construction costs to price, changes in adult population and
 ... increases in real per capita income all are positively related to excess returns or price changes over the subsequent year.''} and that the managers of large pools of capital will have an even greater advantage.

Consistent with the empirical evidence, net returns for investment are increasing with wealth. 
%
%\begin{enumerate}
%\item Given the  common rule that mortgage payments cannot exceed some fraction of disposable income, the wealthy will be able borrow larger amounts and at lower interest rates that the less wealthy. At any distance from the centre they will be able to make a higher bid.
%
%\item The cost of capital is known to differ for rich and poor. Say, for example, the cost of borrowing, $r_i$ for agent $i$ if the base lending rate is $\bar{r}$
% \[ r_i = (A + B \frac{\bar{W}}{W_i})\bar r\]
%where $\bar{W}$ is mean wealth and $W_i$ is individual wealth. Figure~\ref{Fig:BorrowingCost} illustrates the effect.\footnote{Fr\'ed\'erick Demers found that the response of housing investment to interest rates has become more pronounced over time.

%
%\item If agents discount at their borrowing rate, wealthier agents may have a lower subjective rate of time preference and therefore value properties more highly. 
%\end{enumerate}

The implication is that those with more capital will be at an advantage in the urban housing  market. Tax treatment of income and capital gains as well as interest deductability will influence Equation~\ref{Eqn:DecisionRule}'s strength and who benefits most. 

There are some additional implications

%\begin{enumerate}
%\item  expecting greater price appreciation raises expected profitability. The wealthy and financial corporations  are likely to have better price forecasts than  the occasional home buyer.
%\item higher expected  rents may result from expecting greater price appreciation raises expected profitability or greater willingness to raise rents for tenants
%\item There may be scale economies in maintenance  of rented housing
%\item There may be opportunities to shelter income with land held for investment (speculative) purposes
%\end{enumerate}

These items suggest that financial corporations may have advantages relative to individual investors. Combined with better access to capital and interest deductability, it is reasonable to expect that financial corporations, which essentially pool the purchasing power of wealth holders, increasingly dominate urban land markets. %A recent report claimed 15\% of Tioron0's land transa

In the limit it appears that wage income will never be sufficient to support home ownership in growing cities. 
Overall, this suggests rising housing prices are not a bubble because speculation decouples use-value from price setting. %


These observations about  the rate of return on urban capital raise a set of very interesting issues.  


\begin{itemize}
\item The effect of increasing the urban workforce is to increase the marginal products of  both capital and labour throughout the urban economy. This premium on production in cities is positive when $\Lambda'$ is greater than zero.
 \item  As long as $\Lambda'>0$ cities will  grow, potentially leading to the ``catastrophic agglomeration''  that has been noted in other models.  %(\cite{FujitaKrugmanVenables, BaldwinMartin, Krugman1991, Gurwitz2019}).  City size could be bounded, in which case the city system would grow by increasing the number of cities. This appears to depend on the model features and parameters. 
\item Cities will draw investment away from rural and remote areas.
\item Cities will draw labour away from rural and remote areas. 
\item Even in competitive markets capital captures  scale benefits until an entry equilibrium is achieved.
\item Landowners  capture the agglomeration benefits that are not dissipated in transportation costs.
\end{itemize}

These appear to be features of the economy we observe.


\section{The long-run evolution of complex urban systems}

It is clear that cities city systems and city economies are complex systems. Complex systems are sensitive to scale and tend to generate emergent properties over time. In the history of cities we discern a series of transitions arising out of growing size and complexity. There is no reason to  think that evolution has stopped. In fact our analysis has focussed on a significant transition that is currently underway. The transformation of cities as humans become an urban species has had a series of stages, each of which was tied to production technologies and largely determined social relations of the period.

Early cities were built on
