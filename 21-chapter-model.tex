In this thesis  we describe an agent-based spatial model of an urban housing market that includes a production function modelling how urban regions generate wealth and an explicitly financialized housing market.  Where previous chapters discussed general the principles that underlie our theoretical model, this chapter presents details about the how the variables in the computational model are defined. %Where, for example, we talk about expected price in Chapter~\ref{ch_financialization}, here we  provide the formula we use in our simulations.

% The model is introduced in the following sections:
% \begin{enumerate}
% \item In Section~\ref{sec_model_blocks} we  begin by describing the major blocks of the model. 

% \item In Section~\ref{sec_model_dynamics}  we make some comments on the dynamic properties of the model we have constructed. 

% \item In Section~\ref{sec_model_variables} we describe how a series of key  variables are constructed. The variables enter the decision-making process of agents in the market. 

% \item In Section~\ref{sec_model_bid_price}

% \item The treatment of time a periods and discounting is discussed in Section~\ref{sec_model_time}. 
%  Section~\ref{sec_model_price_expectataions}


% \item In Subsection~\ref{sec:Production-fn} we introduce the production function, introduce the labour supply and the urban model, the source of the surplus,  then we calculate profit, consider who gets the profit, and from there we draw our conclusions.. then we calculate the urban surplus, and consider who gets it.

% \section{The three major blocks of the model}\label{sec_model_blocks}

Our goal has been to make a model as accessible as the Alonzo model that can still provide insights about  the impact of financialization of the housing market on urban productivity and wealth distribution.  The  model has three major blocks:

\end{figure}
}

\begin{enumerate}
\item We incorporate the spatial structure of the city and its transportation system using a version of the \gls{bid-rent function} that drives all Alonso-style models. This equation is embedded in the decision of every agent because it determines the economic rent for each piece of property.

\item We incorporate the fundamental wealth production process of the city using an \gls{urban scaling} law that captures Jacobs-style agglomeration effects. This allows us to bypass the complexities of labour and goods market adjustments and instead to deal with the underlying long-term relationship between city population and production. We call the combination of this Jacob agglomeration effect with the Alonso model an \gls{Alonso-Jacobs model}. Together these two difference equations, operating on two aggregate variables, incorporate the major insight of a half-century of \gls{neoclassical growth theory}.

\item To link the Alonso-Jacobs model to the financial system, we develop an \gls{overlapping generations} model of the housing market with borrowers and lenders that tracks ownership and wealth. This turns out to be the most detailed and computationally-intensive part of the model. To model the effects financializing housing an \gls{agent-based model} we are forced to carefully specify the microeconomics of individual decisions. % In Section~\ref{section-micro},
We therefore, we describe the microeconomic objective function that individuals and our bank agent employ in deciding to purchase a property. 
\end{enumerate}

Figure~\ref{fig-flow-full-model} shows the model flow/logic.  The following three sections will discuss each of the three primary components, the spatial structure, the productivity mechanism, and the housing market in order.  To focus the model on the core questions of the relationship between urban productivity and rent, we keep the first two components,  the spatial structure and the growth mechanism,  as simple as possible, modeling the market for housing in more detail. 

% ANALYSIS???Finally, in  Section~\ref{section-system} we explain how financialization might affect the housing market as a system and some consequences for society in general. %At that point we can introduce our specific hypotheses and how we intend to test them.

\subsection{Spatial structure}

% In this section, we introduce the basic structure of the model, drawing on the circular city model.  
%  
% We build a spatially explicit agent model where agents work in one location and incur costs travelling to work. This work integrates a model of production and labour into a standard spatial model of the city. In this section, we introduce an analytic model of production and a labour market in a stylized circular city. 

% \subsection{Labour supply for production}
We begin with a model of a circular city. \footnote{In our computational model we use a grid structure with  a block metric, which is computationally more convenient and provides a slightly more natural representation of the property structure of actual cities.} %- INTRO CITY/APPROACH?
In the \gls{Alonso model} \cite{alonsoTheoryUrbanLand1960, alonsoLocationLandUse1964}, firms are located at the centre of a circular city, the central business district. Residents live distributed across space, can take jobs, and commute to work at the urban center. 
% In the simplest version, firms concentrate at the city centre. Workers are spread over space and pay transportation costs to commute.

Firms produce perfectly \gls{substitutable} % For simplicity, firms produce a variety of  goods, 
which they sell into a commodity market. Demand for the \gls{product} is \gls{perfectly elastic}, so the price remains constant. 

Firms purchase the time of workers. %to capture the product of their effective labour
%and enjoy the product of \gls{effective labour} . They can produce more goods by hiring additional workers. 
With the neoclassical model of distribution,\footnote{Clark's neoclassical assumption \cite{clarkDistributionWealthTheory1899}.} 
% We assume that the neoclassical model of distribution holds in the long run and 
workers receive the value of their marginal product. 

% TODO this shows the dynamics of a local economy, trade dynamics dominate local dynamics in many cases, that is explored with the addition of more cities and centres. 
 
%NEED TO INTRODUCE SUBSISTENCE WAGE BEFORE MENTIONING IT ABOVE %[MAYBE This follows xyz's approach, and makes it possible to explore resident's choice to work]. 


As in the Alonso model, described in Chapter~\ref{chapter-space}. The {urban wage premium} and transportation costs together determine both the radius of the circular city and the size of the labour force, %?There is no fixed boundary and the size of the city is determined by the utility that can be achieved in competing regions of competing for labour.
% and as in the standard circular city model the constraint on growth is provided by transportation costs, which limit the size of the commuter-shed and therefore the labour force at any wage. 
 %The raidus of the commuter shed is thus,  %The farthest workers will travel to work is thus 
% The  productivity of the city attracts people. 
since agents work if the wage premium is greater than the cost of travel. % Living close to work has value to workers because it saves the cost of transportation. 
The higher the wage, the  farther workers will commute. %This is the core of the Alozo circular city model.
The farthest workers will travel  is $\frac{w}{{c}}$, where ${c}$ is the cost of transportation per unit distance. This defines the radius of the city and the commuter shed.

The \gls{urban labour supply} is an \gls{aggregate} measure that emerges from individual agents' choice to commute. Considering a standard, Alonzo-style \gls{circular city} with a uniform lot size, $s$ and  one worker per unit land, for illustrative purposes, the labour available is simply the area of the circle divided by the lot size: 
\begin{equation}
%=  \frac{\pi}{s}(c^{max})^2	
 N = \frac{\pi}{s} \left(\frac{w}{{c}}\right)^2
   =\frac{\pi}{{c}^2 s} w^2,
\label{eqn-labour-supply1}
\end{equation}
This would be the equilibrium \gls{urban labour supply}  for the circular city. For a city with a rectangular grid of streets, the city shape is rectangular rather than circular and the labour supply function is $N= 2\left(\frac{\omega}{c}\right)^2$. %which is a \cite{GET_migration_equilibOR_pop_equilib_condition}. %It defines the quantity of labour available.

%\footnote{See the discussion of model extensions in Appendix~\ref{appendix-future-work}.}.
% To get the \gls{urban wage premium}, we can write the inverse of the labour supply function:
% \begin{equation}
% w= (\frac{ {c}^2s}{\pi})^{0.5} L^{0.5}.
% \label{eqn-inverse-labour-supply}
% \end{equation}

\subsection{Agglomeration and productivity}\label{sec:Production-fn}

% *** ADD BACK? To study the productivity of cities, we incorporate Jacobs-style agglomeration economies (\cite{beaudryWhoRightMarshall2009, vanderpanneAgglomerationExternalitiesMarshall2004, jacobsEconomyCities1969}), using an approach similar to the way the \gls{Solow-Swan model} incorporates labour-augmenting technical change with a \gls{Cobb-Douglas} production function, and building the production function into a standard Alonso-style model of an urban economy.
%, using a simple Cobb-Douglas production function. 
% We incorporate the estimated scaling relationship in 
%The scaling result at the level of the city allows us to incorporate the agglomeration effect in a \gls{circular city} model, 
There is an agglomeration effect that augments the productivity of workers. This means firms produce more goods with a given stock of labour if the city is larger and urban workers are more productive, % than rural workers due to the positive agglomeration externalities. 
so urban firms can pay a premium to attract workers, that depends, among other things on the size of the city. % , above the subsistence wage.
%in a city with more people, as introduced in Chapter~\ref{chapter-growth} on growth.(**E SEE NOTE HERE) % #E i THINK YOU NEED TO FLESH THIS OUT, i'M NOT SURE EXACTLY WHAT YOU ARE SAYING. JUST BE A BIT MORE SPECIFIC AND FLESH OUT. 
% \subsection{Labour force}
%There are also firms that produce goods to sell. (???) % #E HOW IS THIS DIFFERENT THAN THE FIRMS PRODUCING GOODS IN THE PREVIOUS PARAGRAPH???

% Firms sell the goods they produce into a commodity market. 
 %, which are both exported and locally consumed 
% to sell into a large market, at a fixed price. 

To focus the model on urban productivity and the growing urban wage premium, we model workers as receiving a \gls{subsistence wage} $\psi$ in the countryside. Classical economists employed the \gls{subsistence wage} assumption to simplify their analysis in a similar way \cite{GET_classical-subsistence-wage}.
%
% CLASSICAL POLITICAL ECONOMY, THE SUBSISTENCE ...
% American Economic Association
% https://www.aeaweb.org › conference › retrieve
% PDF he Classical Understanding of the Subsistence Wage. While the historical run of classical political economy runs from William Petty through David.
This subsistence wage could come from work in the local community, living off the land, family support, social support, or something else. 
 % The model is set up so that all of an urban  tenant's  income is spent on  basic living costs, $\omega$, transportation $td$ or rent. Disposable income for owner occupier $i$ is therefore just the return  $\omega -dc$ which may accumulate as a financial asset.
% To attract workers to live in the city and commute to the central business district, firms pay the  \gls{urban wage premium}, $\omega$, in addition to  the subsistence wage $\psi$. 
%\footnote{See parameter appendix Section~\ref{section-wage-premium} for a discussion of the empirical literature on the \gls{urban wage premium}.}. 
% When workers take a job, they give up the subsistence income and, % instead receive a wage from their employer. % When workers take a job, they  receive, in addition to the subsistence wage,  the wage premium  from their employer. 

Urban workers give up the subsistence income and receive the \gls{urban wage}, $\psi +  \omega$, the subsistence wage plus the \gls{urban wage premium} that firms pay to attract workers. 
% When we assume an subsistence wage with a specific share  applied to housing we are implicitly assuming that landlords are seeking to claim the value of the rents. It makes it possible to explore whether and how tenants and even owners may be squeezed towards a \gls{subsistence frontier}. %whatever value the can. % tenants are squeezed by landlords. % DOES THE 'THIS' REFER TO THE FORMALIZATION OF WARRANTED RENTS?


According to \gls{neoclassical distribution theory}, the firm maximizes profit by setting the marginal value of the product of each \gls{factor of production} equal to the unit cost per factor. This means the wage premium increases in the same relation to population as \gls{productivity} does:
\begin{equation}
\omega\propto N^{\beta-1}.
\label{eqn-wage-population}
\end{equation}

% The city has single firm facing a fixed price for output. 

% IS THIS DUPLICATION? I THINK THE Solow-Swan model IS INTRODUCED IN SPACE CHAPTER. MOVE THIS TO SPACE CHAPTER IF NEEDED?
% In the \gls{Solow-Swan model}:
% \begin{equation} 
% Y(t) = K(t)^{\alpha}(A(t)L(t))^{\beta}
% \label{eqn-solow-swann}
% \end{equation}
% where $Y$, $K$ and $L$ are aggregate output, capital, and labour, respectively,  $A$ is the term the Solow-Swan model introduced for technology. The technology term capture the growth of labour productivity over time, $\alpha$ is the \gls{elasticity} of output with respect to capital, $\beta$ the elasticity of \gls{output} with respect to \gls{effective labour}, and $t$ time. If $\beta=1-\alpha$, this is a \gls{constant returns to scale} \gls{CRS} production function at the firm level.
% In the Solow-Swan model all factors of production are fully employed, and initial values $A(0)$, $K(0)$, and $n( 0 )$ are given. The number of workers, i.e. labour, as well as the level of technology grows exogenously at rate %s are $n$ and it   $g$,% respectively:  $L(t)=L(0)e^{nt}$     $A(t)=A(0)e^{gn}$ 
% This model uses a similar functional form to look at the effect of population density increasing % productivity. %how density increases in in  % It models how population increases productivity. 

The urban wage premium scales with the agglomeration effect. The \glspl{agglomeration effect} ensure urban \gls{output} is more than proportional to urban population: 
 \begin{equation}
 Y\propto N^{\beta},
 \label{eqn-production-population}
 \end{equation}
where $\beta$ is the elasticity of output with respect to capital, $\beta > 1$ where the agglomeration effect is positive. % Setting $\beta = 1$ would be the \gls{constant returns to scale}. $\beta - 1$ is the extra return that comes from adding to people the city. That return is the agglomeration effect that belongs to the city, it could go to the people.

We can put this together using a model of the production function. We implicitly use a three-factor model of \gls{production}, where production, is a function of capital and labour as well as a third factor, a Solow-Swan style term for labour augmenting technical change, with an \gls{agglomeration} effect, $A(N)$, in place of technology, $A(t)$. Output is:

\begin{equation}
Y=A(N)K^{\alpha }(A(N)N)^\beta.
\label{eqn-prod1}
\end{equation}
where $K$ is capital, $\alpha$ is the elasticity of output with respect to capital, $\alpha = \beta - 1$, and  $n$ is the \gls{urban labour supply}. $A(N)$ incorporates Jacob-style agglomeration externalities. $A(N)N$ is \gls{effective labour}.\footnote{The function  was discussed in Chapter~\ref{chapter-growth}.}

% \section{Agglomeration Appendix: Production Function}
% SORT APPENDIX/OTHER STUFF

% The agglomeration factor increases with population. It multiplies labour because agglomeration scales the productivity of workers.  
% It is a model of a productive urban economy since the centre is productive and demands labour.
% The growth of population feeds back into productivity. % We allow rising population to directly increase the wage.  
% We supplement the spatial model with agglomeration effects consistent with the literature. % in the base model. 
% There is an agglomeration effect, which
% The agglomeration effect means firms can also produce more goods by operating in a city with more people, because of the connections and interactions between people (CITE). 
 
 %, we assume the presence of scaling, consistent with neoclassical growth models as discussed in Chapter~\ref{chapter-growth}. 
%In this section, we introduce the basic structure of the production side and connect it to the literature on urban scaling. 
% We bypass the complexity of modelling firms, allowing population increases to directly increase urban wage premium.
%, It is straightforward to compute the rate of excess return for  this model. 

% We assume that the firm behaves as a price taker in the labour market as well, despite the fact that we model it as a \gls{monopsonist}\footnote{}. JUSTIFY/REPHRASE/EXPLAIN monopsonist. %ALSO DOES THIS GO HERE OR BELONG WITH PRIOR SECTION?

% Labour demand is thus a derived demand based on standard neoclassical theory with an equilibrium wage offer that is the marginal (value) product of labour for the firm. Specifically, hiring proceeds until the marginal product of labour is equal to the wage.

% The firm adjusts its labour force upward when the \gls{marginal product of labour} is greater than the wage by selecting from its list of job applicants.
% The firm adjusts its wage offer upward when the marginal product of labour is greater than the wage and it faces a labour shortage.  Labour shortage is a situation where the firm wants to hire but its list of job applicants is empty.

% The marginal product of labour is monotonically declining, ensuring a labour market equilibrium, to connect with the analytic tradition of economic modelling by ensuring there is an equilibrium level of production.  While adding more labour may always adds some value, the rate at which it adds value drops off. 
% If the marginal product increased, then a firm that got large enough would out compete smaller firms, hire all labour, always be able to produce more wealth by hiring more people, and would always produce more wealth by hiring people than by firing people. This doesn't happen. 
% Perhaps, the firm hires employees who best fit its needs first, but to grow, eventually it must hire less selectively. Finding markets may get harder with growth. Perhaps expansion adds additional costs, building a parking lot, administration, acquiring a larger building. Whatever the explanation, the marginal product of labour declines. 

% Frictional unemployment usually just refers to people moving between jobs. When people look for jobs, it may take time to get them. The analytic model offers an equilibrium solution with full employment. In the agent-based model this assumption does not hold, workers are laid off, and take time to find new employment.
% labour adjustment costs include moving costs for the employee or hiring, firing, or training cost for the firm. (there might be a hiring, firing, or training cost on the firm side, or on the employee side: expected time to employment costs, moving costs, etc.)
% The assumption of monotonically embedded marginal product of labour is embedded in the production function, so it applies in the analytic and agent models. This appears in the requirement that the sum of the exponents in the \gls{Cobb-Douglas} are less than one without agglomeration effects. Agglomeration effects can push the sum above one. When the exponents add up to less than one, there are diminishing returns to scale.  Exploring alternatives would involved exploring other formulations of the production function.

% $mvp(x) = p(x)$ where x can be labour, capital or any other factor, falls out of the function when you introduce profit maximization. Continuity and differentiability assumed but it is a convenient approximation-- take away assumptions you typically get a close approximation.

% We have a two factor model of production with labour and capital.  


\section{The economic value of a property} \label{section-rent}
Property markets are the largest and most complex part of our model. We distinguish economic benefits arising from the services provided by a property from the financial gains that ownership might provide. We have emphasized that urban properties generate economic surpluses that give rise to land rents. We therefore explicitly discuss land rents and their relationship to prices  

 The explicit treatment of rents, prices, and  productivity \gls{premium} and use of the \gls{subsistence wage} as an analytical device  make this a \gls{classical} model despite its reliance on supply and demand modelling of the housing market. 

 To develop the analysis, we track the quantities, outlined in Table~\ref{table-price-notation}.\footnote{In the table, we include indices for agent $i$ and property $j$, for clarity. In the following development we'll only use the subscripts where needed to distinguish between agents and properties.}
% Rents go to the owners of a given property. If workers own their own homes, rents go to them. If others own the land, they can extract the rent. 
%In each period a house offers two kinds of services: {locational services} or  access to the central city job and amenities, and {home services}.  The {warranted rent} is the value of a complex stream of services.

\end{table}
% There are three pieces to this analysis: there's the warranted price based on the underlying economic value of living in a property, the link here with urban productivity, there's the biding and negotiation process, and then there's the realized market price. 



In the model, agents learn or set these values with the support of a real estate agent, and based on information provided by their bank about lending rates, etc. After setting prices, agents engage in a negotiation process. 

The link with urban productivity is made through the land rents distributed through wages and available for distribution. If agents own their own property, they capture the rents. If others own it, they capture the rents.

\subsection{Warranted rent} \label{section-waranted-rent}
\Gls{warranted rent} is the maximum rent that could be extracted from tenants for the stream of services provided by location and the housing supplied. A higher level of rent would convince tenants they are better off leaving the city.
\footnote{The warranted rent can be thought of as a kind of \gls{attractor} or \gls{equilibrium} towards which prices evolve, abstracting %. Including it in the model introduces a long-run equilibrium value, rather than modeling 
the adjustment process. % independent of the tendencies of the market.  
Combining a model of long-run attractor dynamics with distributed agent interactions, combines the advantages of agent-based modeling and standard \gls{classical} and \gls{neoclassical} economic analysis to give insight into the dynamics of financialization. Chapter~\ref{chapter-methodology} on methodology discusses the approach.} 

Capozza et al \cite{capozzaFundamentalsLandPrices1989} show that land price has four additive components: the value of agricultural land rent, the cost of conversion, the value of accessibility, and the value of expected future rent increases. We treat the first two as constants.  

The value of accessibility  can be expanded to include amenities. In our base model it is determined by the urban wage premium, which rests on the productivity of the city. %We include three distinct streams of services, the value of access to employment, which we call economic rent, locational amenities, and housing services.
Expected future price increases are driven by increases in the value of accessibility, which is to say, the rising productivity of the city. Productivity rises in our model due to pure agglomeration effects. Our concern is with what happens to the city and its people when financial capital captures the growing value generated by the agglomeration process.  


\subsubsection{Locational economic rent} \label{section-economic-rent}
The \gls{economic rent} is the value of surplus that arise from access to jobs in the centre of the city where agglomeration economies generate a wage premium. These are represented as %, on an annual basis, 
the wage premium, $\omega$, minus the transportation costs, $c$, for a property a given distance, $d$, from the center:

\[\omega - {dc}.\]

\subsubsection{Locational amenity} \label{section-locational-rent}
The warranted locational rent includes  the economic rent as well as a locational amenity, $\mathbb{A}$. Locational amenity includes very local site-specific amenities like access to schools or views, as well as a general urban amenity function that is the value of living in a particular location $\mathbb{A}$. For most of the discussion in this chapter we ignore locational amenities, although we make provision for them in our computational model.

\subsubsection{Housing services} \label{section-housing-services}
Housing services $\mathcal{H}_j$ are  tied to a particular property. They include the value of features like a building having a certain number of rooms, particular finishes, or landscaping, extensions or upgrades. To maintain our focus on locational rents, we simplify, fixing %the value of housing services, setting 
the value of the stream of housing services to a fraction $a$ of the subsistence wage, $a\psi$.

\subsubsection{Combined equation}
Combining the three streams, the economically \gls{warranted rent}, $\mathcal{R}_W$, is then: 
\begin{align}
\mathcal{R}_W=\omega - {dc} + \mathbb{A} + a\psi.
\label{eqn-warranted-rent}
\end{align}

\subsection{Market rent} \label{section-market-rent}
The \gls{market rent}, $\mathcal{R}_M$, is what tenants actually pay. The market differs from the economically warranted rent as investors make individual decisions about rents, setting rents based on market conditions and their own expectations. 
% As an initial approximation, we simplify, using the warranted rent to approximate the market rent:
% \[\mathcal{R}_{M, 0}= \mathcal{R}_W.\] 
As the simulation proceeds, the market price and market rental price generated by the agent-based housing market mechanism diverges from the economically warranted  rents and prices.

\subsection{Net warranted rent} \label{section-net-rent}
Owners receive, not the total warranted rent, but the \gls{net rent} after expenses, including maintenance, taxes, and the cost of financing. The following sections detail the computation of each expense, and their combination into the net rent calculation.

\subsubsection{Annual taxation}
Owners pay property taxes based on appraised price, $P_{\tau}$:
\begin{align*}
\mathcal{T} &= \tau  \mathcal{P}_{\tau}.
\end{align*}
 
Where $\tau$ is the municipal tax rate or \gls{mill rate}, and the \gls{appraised value} is based somewhat approximately, and with a lag, on the \gls{market price}, so $\mathcal{P}_{\tau}$ is some fraction of $\mathcal{P}_{M, t-n}$.

\subsubsection{Annual maintenance}
Annual maintenance costs apply to buildings and lands but not to locational value, so it can be modeled as a share, $b$, of the housing services costs, $a \psi$: 
\begin{align}
\mathcal{O} &= a b \psi.

\subsubsection{Combined equation}
Combining, the \gls{net rent} is:\footnote{This is the net warranted rent. Market rent, $\mathcal{R}_M$, can be decoupled from this for many reasons. For instance, agents who have purchased a house, may be able to pass a share of financing costs through to tenants as part of the market rent, depending on market power. Some  migrants may accept lower utilities or may have access to higher wages. The market rent could include an additional term, $F(v, rM)$, where $F$ is a function of financing costs that depends on %how tight the market is, 
vacancy, $v$, financing costs, $r$, and the size of the mortgage to be financed, $M$. When all financing costs are passed on the tenant effectively buys the property for the investor. The market rent is what an investor would use for price setting, however we are short-cutting the rent price formation process with a long-run equilibrium approximation based on the rents that can be extracted before people leave the city, so the mechanisms that push rent up to that extraction value are abstracted and we work with the net warranted rent in the price formation model. There would be strong feedback from speculators taking on financing costs  to the level of rents for tenants, and this  then feedback into prices. % These are distinct logics for the rent formation mechanism which can be explored through more explicit models of rental markets. Abstracting them gives a set of easily generalizable simplifications.% The way housing financing costs are passed through to tenants. are computed are detailed in the next sections.

Annual financing costs are $rM$.

\section{Mortgage availability} \label{section-mortgage-availability}
According to the Canada Housing Statistics Program (CHSP), first-time home buyers require a combination of sufficient income and savings in order to enter the housing market. (insert tables? from the CHSP?) In practice, mortgage lenders put two  limits on the size of the mortgage, one based on wealth (a \textbf{wealth constraint}) and one based on income (a \textbf{carrying constraint}). We have implemented these facts by making both mortgage size and the interest rate on borrowing  depend on income and wealth. A result is that high-income and  wealthy agents will be able borrow larger amounts and at lower interest rates than the less wealthy.



\subsubsection{Wealth-based mortgage maximum} 
The availability of capital differs for rich and poor. 
We can define individual wealth as:
\[ W_i= P_i -M_i  +S_i \]
where $P_i$ is the value of owned home, $M_i$ is the  Mortgage on the home, and $S_i$ is personal savings = $age*savings\ rate* income$.

The borrowing ratio, $m$ is the fraction of a property's price that can be mortgaged. We assume that the bank uses a function of the form 
\begin{align}
m_i^{max\_permitted} =& \mathrm{max\_mortgage\_share} - \left(\frac{W_i}{\bar W}\right)^{\mathrm{wealth\_sensitivity}} \label{eqn-wealth-based-mortgage}  
\end{align} 
Where $\bar{W}$ is mean wealth and $W_i$ is individual wealth.\footnote{ The median net worth of Canadian households is \$329,900, while the average net worth in Canada is \$738,200 \cite{WEB-model-stats-can-median-net-worth}.} Figure~\ref{fig-borrowing-ratio} illustrates the model for a maximum mortgage  share of 0.9 and a wealth sensitivity 0.1.

The general relationship we describe here is clearly established empirically \cite{}, but we have not found  estimates precise form or parameters. The institutional investor in our model has a borrowing ratio close to or at the maximum, since it is not asset constrained. The borrowing ratio for the median wealth holder, perhaps 0.8.

    \caption{Individual borrowing ratio $m_i$ as a function of wealth}
    \label{fig-borrowing-ratio}
    \end{figure}


\subsubsection{Income-based mortgage maximum}
The borrowing of most agents will be constrained. A common rule is that mortgage payments cannot exceed some fraction of disposable income. 
Many personal finance experts recommend total housing costs account for less than 28\% of \textbf{gross} household income. This gives us an \textbf{income-based  mortgage maximum} of 

\[M^{max}_{Y,i} = \frac{0.28*(\omega+ \psi + r_iS_i)}{r_{prime}}\label{eqn-income-based-mortgage}\] 
\[M^{max}_Yi = min\left\{\frac{0.28*(\omega+w)}{r_i},  0.8P_0 \right\} \]
Where $r_i$ is $i$'s rate of return on savings $S$ as the maximum a  buyer should pay.
%\footnote{If the expected return on a property is greater than the individual cost of borrowing, it would pay any agent to borrow as much as possible and purchase properties as they can available.}
The value 0.28 is represents an estimate of $i$'s carrying capacity ($\mathrm{cc}$?). In our model the bank uses a rule of this form to decide how much it is willing to lend to $i$.

\subsubsection{Combined mortgage maximum permitted by the bank for new buyers and second home buyers}

  \begin{figure}
    \centering
    \input{fig/dual-constraint.tex}
    \caption{The bank's dual mortgage constraint and the savings constraint determine the maximum bid price}
    \label{fig:dual-constraint}
    \end{figure}

The above  two equations specify two constraints on the mortgage.  Combining them we get:
\begin{align} 
M_i^{max} &= min \left\{ m_i^{max\_permitted}*P, \ M^{max\_permitted}_i \right\} 
\label{eqn-max-mortgage-combined}
\end{align}
The two constraints on  mortgage size that the bank imposes are incorporated in the kinked red line in Figure~\ref{fig:dual-constraint}. The maximum  permitted mortgage is combined with the savings constraint to determine the maximum price that a potential home buyer can offer.   

% \[M^{max}_{UY,i} = \frac{0.28*(\omega+ \psi)}{r_i}\] 
% It is the maximum the bank will let you pay.

% \subsection{The cost of capital}
% The cost of capital is known to differ for rich and poor. This model ties the individual cost of capital,  $r_i$ for agent $i$, to a prime rate, $\bar r$, and to individual wealth. Figure~\ref{fig-borrowing-cost} illustrates the cost of the borrowing model we implement, 
%  \[ r_i = (A + B \frac{\bar{W}}{W_i})\omega\]
% Where $\bar{W}$ is mean wealth and $W_i$ is individual wealth.

% a kink because there are 2 constraints.  The actual mortgage must be below both lines.
The diagonal line, the top dashed diagonal line, is just the price, P = mortgage + savings.

The cost of capital differs for rich and poor. We tie the individual cost of capital,  $r_i$ for agent $i$, to the lender's target rate $r^{target}$, and to individual wealth. Figure~\ref{fig-capital-cost} illustrates the cost of the borrowing model we implement, which is  roughly consistent  with the stylized facts about lenders. 
 
\begin{equation}
r_i = r^{target}+ K/(W-W_{min}) -K/(\bar W - W_{min})\label{eqn-interest-wealth-relationship}
\end{equation}
where  $r^{target}$ is the bank's target rate of return,  $\bar{W}$ is mean wealth and $W_i$ is individual wealth, $W_{min}$ is the level of wealth the bank requires to lend at all, and $K$ is a parameter for the wealth-sensitivity of lending.\footnote{The median after-tax income of Canadian families and unattached individuals was \$66,800 in 2020 according to Statistics Canada. %'s

\section{Bid price}\label{sec_model_bid_price}
A bidding process determines the realized market price, with bidders taking into account potential capital gains. In this section, we describe the formation of the maximum bid price, $P_{B,ij}^{max}$, where i and j refer to the individual and the property involved.\footnote{We suppress the $ij$ identifiers for the rest of this chapter. } The maximum bid price is the value of a property to the owner or to a potential buyer. It will differ across individuals depending on their cost of capital, discount rates,  savings, and access to mortgage funding. It also serves as the minimum price that an owner will sell a property for,  i.e., as a reservation price. It is used in the bargaining model.

There are two types of investment buyers: institutional buyers and homeowners buying an investment home. They use the same investment formula, but may have different values of the parameters that determine their bid prices.

We first calculate the net present value of the purchase, then divide by the amount of capital employed, which we assume is simply the size of the down payment made at the beginning of the period. This gives us a rate of return
.\footnote{A common approach would be to calculate an internal rate of return (IRR), but  the IRR is in general the solution to a polynomial and does not guarantee a single-valued result \cite{robinsonOptimalTerminationIRR1996}. 
Multiple real-valued  IRRs may arise;  complex-valued IRRs may arise;  the IRR is, in general, incompatible with the net present value (NPV) in accept/reject decisions; the IRR ranking is, in general, different from the NPV ranking; the IRR criterion is not applicable with variable costs of capital. Ways to salvage the IRR as a usable criterion have been proposed that are consistent with our approach. \cite{magniAverageInternalRate2010}} 


\subsection{Price expectations}
The \gls{market price} or the price at which a property is exchanged on the market, $P_M$ will not be known in advance, nor will the future sale price.\footnote{Case and Shiller point out ``\dots we see a market largely driven by expectations. People seem to form their expectations from past price movements rather than having any knowledge of fundamentals. This means that housing price booms will persist as home buyers become destabilizing speculators''  \cite{caseThereBubbleHousing2003}. Case and Schiller\cite{caseThereBubbleHousing2003} argue that  the 1-year expectations are fairly well described as attenuated versions of lagged actual 1-year price changes.}  In order to make decisions, agent $i$ must form an \glspl{expectation} or prediction $P_{M_i}^{\epsilon}$ of an as yet unrealized future market price. Agent $i$'s expected market price may be affected by individual information, biases, preferences, and any assumptions the agent has about the behaviour of others, the system state.  


% The underlying value of a home is the capitalized value of the services it provides, which are perpetual.  Rents, however, depend on urban productivity and may change over time. Any expected increase in future rents capitalized into the market price of a home as a capital gain for the owner. Home prices should respond to expectations.

% As Horowitz \cite{horowitzBiddingModelsHousing1986} notes, a prospective buyer considering a vector of attributes of the property, including the seller's asking price and the property taxes, transaction costs, and financing costs at a specified price. The  potential buyer also is likely to have estimates of the maintenance costs and resale value of the house, although these may be highly subjective. All of these factors shape whether an investment is profitable. To make a comparison with alternative investments, it is necessary to compute a rate of return. 

To calculate agent bid prices, we first calculate the net present value of the purchase, then divide by the capital employed, which we assume is the size of the down payment made at the beginning of the period.\footnote{For expositional convenience, we can treat the mortgage period $T$ as a single term and all payments are accumulated to the end of the tern and then discounted to the present.} 
 This gives us a rate of return.\footnote{A common approach would be to calculate an internal rate of return (IRR), but  the IRR is in general the solution to a polynomial and does not guarantee a single-valued result \cite{robinsonOptimalTerminationIRR1996}. Multiple real-valued  IRRs may arise;  complex-valued IRRs may arise;  the IRR is, in general, incompatible with the net present value (NPV) in accept/reject decisions; the IRR ranking is, in general, different from the NPV ranking; the IRR criterion is not applicable with variable costs of capital. Ways to salvage the IRR as a usable criterion have been proposed that are consistent with our approach \cite{magniAverageInternalRate2010}, which is to calculate an NPV then convert it to a rate.} 
The rate of return on the investment must exceed some required rate of return. This condition allows us to calculate the maximum price that will satisfy that criterion.
% We assume that agent may be  speculating on potential \glspl{capital gain} as well as on the \gls{use value} or net market rent they get from the property. We therefore treat the purchase as an investment decision and compute a rate of return, $v$, conditional on the price paid. This allows us to 
We sthen olve this for  the maximum bid, $P_{max}^{bid}$ that achieves the desired rate of return. 

The agent who purchases makes a down payment, $D$ on a house for a price, $P_0$, and agrees to pay off a mortgage, $M$ with interest at the end of the mortgage period.  The purchaser  receives the increased price $P_T = (1 + \dot P)^TP_0 = (1+\dot P^T)P_0$, after a period $T$, Where $\dot P$ is the expected annual rate of price increase and we define $\dot P^T$ as the T-period  price-growth rate. The agent also receives either the net market rental value of the property throughout the period, $\mathcal{R}_N$, or if the owner is also the resident, the locational rents. 
 
% With a price-growth rate of $\dot P$ per year, the growth over $T$ years is $(1+\dot P)^T$, and  %and a 5 year mortgage period, 
% the expected price at the end of the period is:

% \[P_M^{Te}=P_0(1+\dot P)^T\]

% If, for example price growth is 10\%, $\dot P= 0.1$, the {capital gain}, or growth, over a 5-year mortgage term is 0.61051 $\approx$ 60\% of the original price, $P_0$.

The rate of price growth, $\dot P$, is an estimate approximation based on rents and past market behaviour. In our computational model we employ a regression model to generate an \gls{expected market price} based on past prices. The rate of price growth $\dot P$ we use in our model of investor behaviour is derived from the same regression model.

 \subsection{The value of an investment with price growth}
% \subsection{The value of an investment}
The value $V$ of a property investment over a period of T years is  the capital gain, $P_{T}-P_{0}$, minus financing costs, plus net rent revenues. Both mortgage payments and net rent revenues can  be calculated as sum  of regular payments, each of  which accumulates interest to the end of the mortgage period. This is called a ``uniform series compound amount'' and is calculated for net rent as\footnote{Any annual payment for a period multiplied by the factor $\frac{(1+r)^n-1}{r}$ is called a  ``uniform series compound amount''.%source https://www.e-education.psu.edu/eme460/node/659
} 
\[\mathcal{\bar{R}}^T_N= \frac{(1+r)^T-1}{r}\mathcal{R}_N  \]
The regular mortgage payment is  $rM=rmP_0$,\footnote{we assume that the regular payment covers only the interest and that the full mortgage is due at the end of the period } and the uniform series compound amount is
\[\bar{rmP_0}^T= \frac{(1+r)^T-1}{r}rmP_0  \]
Both these amounts are discounted by $\delta^T$ to the present in our calculation.
 
 
% \[\mathcal{\bar{R}}^T_N=  \delta^T\frac{(1+r)^T-1}{r}\mathcal{R}_N  \]
% To keep the notation simple, let 
% \[\delta_r^T=\delta^T\frac{(1+r)^T-1}{r}\]
% The present value of the mortgage repayment plus the accumulated interest be 
% \[\bar M^T_r = \delta^T\frac{(1+r)^T-1}{r}\]
 We can write $V$ in terms of the purchase price, and several individual parameters: interest  rate, share of the price that can be mortgaged and  discount rate:%\footnote{The down payment could be deducted in advance, but if the discount rate is equal to the interest rate it drops out completely.}
 
 \begin{align}
V &= \delta^T\left( P^T-P_0- \left(\frac{(1+r)^T-1}{r}rM\right)- M+ \mathcal{\bar{R}}^T_N \right)      \\
&= \delta^T \left(
\dot P^T P_0 -\left((1+r)^T-1\right)mP_0-mP_0
 +  \mathcal{\bar{R}}^T_N \right) 
\label{first_sub}\\
  &= \delta^T \left(\dot P^T - (1+r)^T)m P_0 + \mathcal{\bar{R}}^T_N\right)
\end{align}
where $\dot P^T$  is the expected rate of change in the market price over the term of the mortgage.
$V$ is the net present value of buying and selling after one mortgage renewal period of $T$ years. %All rates are scaled to the length of the period to avoid the need for compounding calculations. 
The function has 4 individualized  parameters, $\delta$, $\dot p$, $r$, $m$, as well as any factors that affect the rent term.

{\color{black}

\subsection{Rate of return on investment}
We divide V by the size of the down payment, $D$ to get the  rate of return  

\begin{align}
r^{return} =
  &= \frac{V}{D}  \nonumber \\
  &= \delta^T \left(\dot P^T - (1+r)^T)m \frac{P_0}{D} + \frac{\mathcal{\bar{R}}^T_N}{D}\right)\\
  &= \delta^T \left(\dot P^T - (1+r)^T)m \frac{P_0}{P_0-mP_0} + \frac{\delta_r^T\mathcal{\bar{R}}^T_N}{P_0-mP_0}\right)\\  
  &= \frac{\delta^T}{1-m} \left(\dot P^T - (1+r)^T)m  + \frac{\mathcal{\bar{R}}^T_N}{P_0}\right)\\
\end{align}
Notice that the return depends on the price paid, $P_0$.

\subsection{Criterion for investment}
Equation~\ref{{eq:rate-of-return-on-investment}} provides a criterion for investors
.%\footnote{Section~\ref{sec-extensions-conversion}, in Appendix~\ref{appendix-future-work}, discusses the potential for more detailed modelling of the land assembly and development process.} 
 Agents invest if  their expected return is greater than the target return they are seeking:
\begin{equation}
r^{target}\le r^{return} 
\label{eqn-property-investment-return2}
\end{equation}

% Equation~\ref{eqn-return-on-investment} makes it clear that the estimated rate of return depends on subjective magnitudes,$\delta$ and $\dot P_M^e$, attributes of the property, $ \mathcal{R}_N$, and  individual financial position, $r$, $m$.
% 

\subsection{Maximum bids}
The maximum price in Equation~\ref{eqn-property-investment-return1} that the investor can price offer for the property  and still satisfy the inequality~\ref{eqn-property-investment-return2} $P_B^{max}$ is

\begin{align}
r^{target}& \le \frac{\delta^T}{1-m} \left(\dot P^T - (1+r)^T)m  + \frac{\mathcal{\bar{R}}^T_N}{P_B^{max}}\right)\nonumber\\
% (1-m)r^{target}/\delta^T &\le \dot P^T - (1+r)^Tm  +   \frac{\mathcal{\bar{R}}^T_N}{P_B^{max}} \\
% (1-m)r^{target}/\delta^T - \dot P^T + (1+r)^Tm &\le  \frac{\mathcal{\bar{R}}^T_N}{P_B^{max}}\nonumber\\
P_B^{max} &\le  \frac{\mathcal{\bar{R}}^T_N}{(1-m)r^{target}/\delta^T - \dot P^T + (1+r)^Tm} \label{eqn:maximum-bid}
\end{align}

% \begin{eqnarray}
% P_B^{max} & \le    \frac{\mathcal{\bar{R}}^T_N}{(1-m)r^{target}-\delta \left(1 + \dot P_M^e - (1+r)m\right)} \label{eqn-bid-price} \end{eqnarray}
% % P_B & \le    \frac{\mathcal{R}_N}{(1-m)r^{target}-\left[ \delta(1+L(P)- (1+r)m\right]}
We call this  $i's$ maximum bid and compute it for all potential buyers and sellers. It represents he value of the stream of rent plus any capital gains and is therefore the most reasonable reservation price as well.
The denominator can be seen as an adjusted rate of return for capitalizing net rents, analogous to the value of $r$ in  the standard capitalization formula
.\footnote{We could allow potential buyers  to approach potential sellers who have not listed with an offer and allow worker-owners to consider retiring early or becoming tenants if an offer is attractive.  This is only likely if speculative pressures are strong. It may require having multiple institutional buyers to make offers more competitive. In that case, initial offers will be closer to the maximum bid price, tending to pull prices up and benefit potential sellers.}  
}
%Buyers will not initially bid the maximum and sellers will generally set an asking price $P^{ask}$ higher than their reservation price $P_R$, so we build a simple bargaining process.

{\color{blue}
\section{Reservation prices} 
Agents receive bids. They will only sell if it is worthwhile to sell. The calculate a reservation price, and will accept bids above that price. 
INTRODUCTION TO WHAT THIS IS AND WHERE IT GOES.

SOME THE SAME FOR ALL BUYERS, SOME OUR MAIN ARGUMENT, AND SOME IS FOOTNOTES.



Bargaining models attempt to identify the way the surplus available from a transaction is divided between the parties involved. The classic  formulation by John Nash %\cite{Nash_John% (1953-01-01). "Two-Person Cooperative Games". Econometrica. 21 (1): 128–140. doi:10.2307/1906951. JSTOR 1906951} 
identifies a `disagreement point,' which which is the  lowest value each player will accept. In bargaining over a price the lowest value for the seller is called the  `\gls{reservation price}.' The reservation  price for the seller is the highest amount the seller is willing to pay, which is the maximum bid price that we  have just calculated.  

 All owners and potential buyers have  reservation prices. They represents the owner's best alternative. If the a maximum bid is higher than the reservation price the outcome a bargaining model selects a value between to two between the two. Differences in relative power tip the outcome in favour of the stronger. Low vacancy rates, for example, favour owners over tenants.  Excess demand favours buyers.
 
\subsection{Seller's reservation price} \label{section-reservation-price}
The general rule is that any owner will sell if they receive an offer greater than the maximum they would bid for their property according to Equation~\ref{eqn:maximum-bid}.  This includes institutional owners and individual owners fo revenue properties ,l as well as individuals who
%We will assume,  that for owners, deciding to sell is a life-cycle decision. Home owners-workers  
reach the end of their working lives, no longer need access to the central city, and put their homes on the market, making room for new workers to enter the urban market.%\footnote{The timing decision can be randomized, but that is highly unlikely to affect results.} 


If no sale is made, Equation~\ref{eqn:maximum-bid} provides the owner with an estimate of the rents that would be earned by keeping the property as an incom property for another period.\footnote{Worker-owners could remain in their homes after retirement. In that case,  there would be fewer homes available for new workers, which must produce a labour shortage in this model, driving up wages, and leading to higher bids and rising home prices, which in turn attracts  speculative bidding. This will only accelerate any shift in the ownership pattern. Our core model suppresses labour market dynamics and the effect of housing shortages to focus on the warranted prices, which are driven by aggregation economies.}  

 This stream must be discounted at the personal discount rate or at the personal borrowing rate.\footnote{As a further extension, worker-owners in the final few years of their working life might decide to list if they notice that the expected price posted by the real estate agent, $P_M^e$,  exceeds (say) 95\% of their reservation price. This is a `hopeful' listing, `fishing' for an offer that exceeds the actual reservation price.}


% \subsubsection{for the Investor-owner}
% \textbf{For financial sector in general including those holding investment properties} the problem is easier if anyone offers more than your maximum bid, you should sell the property. 
% \begin{eqnarray}
% P_{bank}^{reservation} & =    \frac{\mathcal{R}_N}{(1-m)r^{target}-\delta \left(1 + \dot P_M^e - (1+r)m\right)} \label{eqn-res-price-B} \end{eqnarray}

% P_B & \le    \frac{\mathcal{R}_N}{(1-m)r^{target}-\left[ \delta(1+L(P)- (1+r)m\right]}
We call this  $i's$ maximum bid and compute it for all potential buyers and sellers. In each sale the highest $P_B$ will make the purchase. The denominator can be seen as an adjusted rate of return for capitalizing net rents, analogous to the value of $r$ in  the standard capitalization formula. 
% \[P^{ask}>P_M^e> 0.95 P^r\]
% Otherwise
% \[P^{ask}> 1.10P^r>P_M^e\]
% If no offer exceeds the reservation price, no sale is made.

% Once an owner reached retirement age, if no sale is made the reservation price is reduced for the next cycle.
% If no sale is made the owner considers becoming a landlord. if the present value of net rent is above the reservation price, the owner rents out the home.

\subsubsection{CUT Maximum bid second house buyer}

CUT People are limited by the limits  that the bank imposes borrowing capacity. Purchasing a revenue house is only attractive if the rate return on a rental house exceeds the cost of capital $r_i$. Call this the \textbf{profitability constraint} The maximum bid for this investor is given by Equation~\ref{eqn-max-investment-bid} using one period values for $r_i^{target},\ m_i,\ \delta_i$, and $r_i$.

CUT \begin{eqnarray}\label{eqn-max-second-bid}
P_{second}^{max\_bid} & = \frac{\mathcal{R}_N}{(1-m_i^{max\_permitted})r_i^{target}-\delta_i \left(1 + \dot P_M^e - (1+r_i)m_i^{max\_permitted}\right)} 
\end{eqnarray}
Notice that this simplifies if any of $r_i^{target},\ \delta_i$, and $r_i$ are set equal. It is possible the cost of capital and the target rate will be the same.

CUT Combining the investment \textbf{profitability constraint} and mortgage constraints


MAKE A FOOTNOTE. Note if it was a second buyer, they would have a couple of constraints. The price can't exceed these values.
\begin{eqnarray}
P_{second}^{max\_bid} & = min \left\{P_{second}^{max\_bid},\ \frac{\mathrm{savings}_i}{1-m_i^{max\_permitted}},\ \mathrm{saving}s_i + M_i^{max\_permitted}  \right\}  \nonumber
\end{eqnarray}

\subsubsection{CUT Reservation prices for investment owners}
If the current owner of an investment  property gets a high offer higher than their own maximum bid, they will always sell.  


\subsection{New buyer maximum bids and reservation prices }
A new buyer chooses to move if the income in the city, including the wage amenities exceed the rural income after housing costs, $\psi+A^{Rural}$. 

There are two cases - moving as a buyer and moving as a renter.

\subsubsection{KEEP Moving as a renter}
The gain for a potential renter is 
\begin{align}
gain^{rent}=&net^{city}-net^{Rural}\nonumber\\
=&\left[\psi+\omega-cd+\mathbb{A}^{city}-\mathcal{R}\right]-\left[\psi+\mathbb{A}^{Rural}-a\psi\right] \nonumber\\
=&\ \omega-cd+\mathbb{A}^{net}-\mathcal{R}
\label{eq-move-to-rent}
\end{align}
If rent $\mathcal{R}$ exactly capture housing cost and locational rent, the gain reduces to $\mathbb{A}^{city}-\mathbb{A}^{Rural}$. Normally we would expect property rents to capture this component  as well. 

\subsubsection{KEEP Moving as a buyer}
The gain for a buyer is 
\begin{align}
gain^{buy}=&\ net^{city}-net^{Rural}\nonumber\\
=&\left[\psi+\omega-cd+\mathbb{A}^{city}+(\dot p-r_im_i)P-a\psi\right]-\left[\psi+\mathbb{A}^{Rural}-a\psi\right] \nonumber\\
=&\ \omega-cd+\mathbb{A}^{net}+(\dot p-r_im_i)P  \label{eq-move-to-buy}
\end{align}
This requires that the sum of  locational rent, net amenity and net capital gain be greater than or equal to zero for the in-migrant to buy.

The two decisions  are 
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Move only if $max\{gain^{buy},\ gain^{rent}\} \ge 0$, otherwise do not move to the city.
    
    \item Buy a house if $(\dot p-r_im_i)P\ge  \mathcal{R}$, otherwise rent.
\end{enumerate}

The buyer is subject to the mortgage constraints in Equation~\ref{eqn-max-mortgage-combined}.

We will assume that a first-home buyer always takes the maximum mortgage available to maximize the financial return on the transaction. 

The maximum price a new buyer can bid is also given the bank imposed liquidity constraint is given by Equation~\ref{eqn-max-mortgage-combined}, which we repeat here


\begin{align}
P_i^{max\ bid}= min \left\{\frac{\mathrm{savings}_i}{1-m_i^{max\_permitted}},\  M_i^{max\_permitted} + \mathrm{saving}s_i  \right\}   \nonumber  
\end{align}


\section{Reservation Price}



\subsection{Reservation price for retirees}
Both owners and tenants retire. Homes only become available if they move to the country. 



\subsubsection{Why would a renter move to the country?} 
If the rent is greater than the cost of housing in the country and the lost amenity
\[\mathcal{R} > \ a\psi+ \mathbb{A}^{net}0\]

\subsubsection{Why would an owner move to the country?}
Why would an owner sell a home and move to the country? It would be economically advantageous if the interest on income from the sale exceeds the cost of housing in the country and the lost amenity.
\[r_i(P^{realized}-M) >\ a\psi+ \mathbb{A}^{net}\label{eq:movers-gainA}\]

This value provides a \textbf{reservation price}: 
\[P^{reservation} =\ \frac{a\psi+ \mathbb{A}^{net}}{r_i}+M \label{eq:movers-gainB}\]
This just says that the lowest prices one would sensibly accept is the cost of a house in the country plus enough to cover the mortgage, plus capitalized net amenity.\footnote{transaction costs on the sale are omitted. Add a parameter or variable.}

Should a retiree rent the house out? only if the rent exceeds the  interest on income from the sale:
\[\mathcal{R}^{net}>r_i(P^{realized}-M)\]
This value provides a \textbf{another reservation price}: 
\[P^{reservation} =\ \frac{\mathcal{R}^{net}}{r_i}+M \label{eq:movers-gainC}\]


Sellers should use the investment rule calculated before  do determine a  reservation price in the bargaining process. If they can't get a higher price they  can keep the home as a rental  investment and use the home as collateral for a mortgage on a house in the country.
% For a homeowner, the reservation price is tricky. 
% At this point we only have retirement as a hard boundary to consider. That means that the householder wants to sell in the current period. The gain from moving to the country is 
% \begin{equation}
% Gain=P_{ij}^{expected}-M-\frac{a\psi}{r\_prime} - transaction\ costs - Urban Amenity\  
% \end{equation}\label{eq:movers-gain}
% In the initial model  there are no urban amenities and no transaction costs. We could subtract an urban amenity term, $U_{ij}$ and an transaction cost from equation~\ref{eq:movers-gain}. The amenity term is likely to have little effect, since a buyer will pay extra for the amenity. the transaction cost is actually large and is likely to significantly affect land allocation efficiency.  

The reservation price in in Equation~\ref {eq:movers-gain} is the minimum provides an incentive to sell a home immediately on retiring from the workforce. 



If the sale is delayed by one period, however, the gain is deferred, so the present discounted cost of waiting is, $Gain*\frac{\delta}{1+\delta}$.\footnote{This is simply (1 minus the discount factor) times the deferred amount.} A seller would accept a lower price to avoid this cost of waiting. 

My suggestion is that $\frac{\delta}{1+\delta}P_{ij}^{expected}$ is the \textbf{initial reservation price} for a homeowner on retirement. If the seller does not get this she reduces the reservation price for the next period by (say) 5\% .

\subsection{Many-to-many matching problem}
\textbf{We have a many-to-many matching problem}. Many buyers and sellers single sellers for each unit. Therefore, for each property that comes on the market each potential seller has a reservation price $P_{ij}^{reservation}$ and there will be a set\footnote{We could allow potential buyers  to approach potential sellers who have not listed with an offer and allow worker-owners to consider retiring early or becoming tenants if an offer is attractive.  This is only likely if speculative pressures are strong. It may require having multiple institutional buyers to make offers more competitive. In that case, initial offers will be closer to the maximum bid price, tending to pull prices up and benefit potential sellers.}  of potential buyers with maximum bids $P_{ij}^{maxbid}$.


This will appear in your data as a set of bids and a reservation price for each property on the market that must be converted to a price for that property using the bargaining rule. The rule is simple: 
\begin{enumerate}
    \item if there is only one maximum bid above the reservation price, split the difference.

    \item If there are two or more maximum bids above the reservation price, the property goes to the highest  and the price is the second highest
\end{enumerate}


\subsection{Another version}
In reality, sellers often post an asking price greater than the reservation price. All agents will expect to negotiate, however, so we assume instead that if there is a deal, it will result in a price between the bid and the reservation price, treating the higher asking price and bids as `cheap talk'\footnote{In game theory, cheap talk is communication between players that does not directly affect the payoffs of the game. Providing and receiving information is free. This is in contrast to signaling in which sending certain messages may be costly for the sender depending on the state of the world.} since a price outside of this range cannot be a rational choice for both sides, so it is ruled out in Nash bargaining theory.

The bargaining  mechanism then simply has to compare the maximum bid price $P_B$ with the seller's reservation price. If the $P_B^{max}>P_R$, a deal that is between the two values is possible. Otherwise, the transaction does not proceed.

If there are competing buyers with maximum bids higher than the reservation price, only the highest two need be considered. The second highest max bid should be the sale price, but the bidder with the highest max bid wins the property. This is realistic because in a bidding war the final bid only has to be a small amount higher than that of the last competitor left. That is the highest price that a seller can normally get.\footnote{This is an application of Vickrey \gls{second-price auction} theory. Bidders are asked to submit sealed bids. %b1, \dots 
The bidder who submits the highest bid is awarded the object, and pays the amount of the second highest bid \cite{levinAuctionTheory2004}.}

If $P_B^{max}>P_R$,  the bargaining rule selects a value 
\[P = xP_B^{max*}+(1-x)P_R\]
where $0\ge x\ge 1$ is approximately 0.5 but shifts upward when it is a sellers market and downward in a buyer's market.\footnote{In an overheated housing market bid prices might exceed asking prices, but the price wont exceed the maximum expected profitable bid price, $P_B^{max*}$.} We will call this term am measure of \gls{sellers' bargaining power}.  The sellers' bargaining power can be shifted downward if the home fails to sell in the first period it is on the market. 

\subsection{The process}
\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{identify the pool of sellers} for each cycle.
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Agents who a) own and b) age out
        \item Agent  who failed to sell in the previous period.
        \item the bank
    \end{enumerate}
\item \textbf{identify the pool of buyers} 
    \begin{enumerate}
         \item newcomers, 
         \item individuals as investors.
         \item the bank may buy many, (There must be a capital (C) constraint something like $C/\bar P$ to select a number of bank bids in any period.)
    \end{enumerate}

\item \textbf{count buyers and sellers} and use the counts to identify sellers or buyers' market. \# Sellers > \# buyers is a buyers/ market. For a buyer's market  choose the lower price. \footnote{.The is often done with buyers/vacancies. Changes in this ratio are observed to trigger significant movement in rent r market prices.\cite{wheatonVacancySearchPrices1990}. Lisi and Iacobini \cite{lisiEstimatingHousingPrice2015} found  that in the Italian market, ``the difference between the actual selling price and the price obtained in an ideal situation of frictionless housing market – is remarkable. ... the higher the trading frictions on the demand side (more buyers and less sellers), the higher the actual selling price (the price adjustment is positive), whereas the higher the trading frictions on the supply side (less buyers and more sellers), the lower the actual selling price (the price adjustment is negative). '' (they point out that ``Trading frictions are obvious in the housing market, as it takes weeks or months to buy or sell a house (Caplin and Leahy, 2011; Rocheteau and Weill, 2011).'')}  

%a key role is played by the so-called “time-on-the-market (TOM)”. The time it takes to sell a property or “the expected time until the asset is sold when following the optimal policy” (Lippman and McCall, 1986) – commonly known as the TOM – measures the degree of illiquidity of the real estate asset and is a fundamental characteristic differentiating real estate from financial assets. \cite{lisiSearchMatchingProcess2019}
\item \textbf{The pooling problem}  Houses should go at different prices if they have different net rents.  Assume buyers and sellers are indifferent about location (no  local amenities) so only the net rent matters for the ban and only the full rent for individuals.

\item \textbf{Create lists} for the buyer pool and the seller pool. (The bank can appear on the list many times.) 

If the market is efficient, the allocation will maximize the sum or seller and buyer surplus.

\item To select the set of transactors, \textbf{order the lists}. Buyers from highest to lowest, sellers from lowest to highest.

\end{enumerate}


% Ensure that they are of the same length by dropping the lowest bids or the highest reservation prices.
