% \section{The general structure of the model}
The main goal of this research is to add a financial system to a spatial urban model %to the simple Alonzo model 
in order to examine the impact of financialization of the housing market on urban productivity and distribution. To do this we develop an \gls{agent-based model} with three major components:

\end{figure}
}

\begin{enumerate}
\item We incorporate the spatial structure of the city and its transportation system using a version of the \gls{bid-rent function} that drives all Alonzo-style models. This equation is embedded in the decision of every agent because it determines the economic rent  for each piece of property..

\item We incorporate the fundamental wealth production process of the city by using an \gls{urban scaling} law that captures Jacobs-style agglomeration effects. This allows us to bypass the complexities of labour and goods market adjustments and and instead to deal with the underlying long-term relationship between city  population and production. We have called the combination of this Jacob agglomeration effect with the Alonzo model an \gls{Alonzo-Jacobs model}.  Two difference equations operating on two aggregate variables incorporate the major insight of a half-century of \gls{neoclassical growth theory}.

\item To link the Alonzo-Jacobs model to the financial system, we develop an \gls{overlapping generations} model of the housing market with borrowers and lenders that tracks ownership and wealth. This turns out to be the most detailed and computationally-intensive part of the model. To model the effects financializing housing an \gls{agent-based model} we are forced to carefully specify the microeconomics of  individual decisions. In Section~\ref{section-micro}, therefore, we describe the microeconomic objective function that individuals and our bank agent employ in deciding to purchase a property. 
\end{enumerate}

To recapitulate, we have a spatial model of an urban housing market, a production function modelling how urban regions generate wealth, and an analysis of distribution within that model that incorporates the financial system.

Figure~\ref{figure-logic} shows the model flow/logic. 
The following three sections with discuss each of the three primary components, the spatial structure, the productivity mechanism, and the housing market in order. (CHECK ORDER IN INTRO), Finally, in  Section~\ref{section-system} we explain how financialization might affect the housing market as a system and some consequences for society in general. %At that point we can introduce our specific hypotheses and how we intend to test them.

\section{Spatial structure}

% In this section, we introduce the basic structure of the model, drawing on the circular city model.  
%  we introduce the production function, introduce the labour supply and the urban model, the source of the surplus,  then we calculate profit, consider who gets the profit, and from there we draw our conclusions.. then we calculate the urban surplus, and consider who gets it. 
% % In subsequent sections  .. (Derivation details in section \ref{Sec:Derivations})
% We build a spatially explicit agent model where agents work in one location and incur costs travelling to work. This work integrates a model of production and labour into a standard spatial model of the city. In this section, we introduce an analytic model of production and a labour market in a stylized circular city. 

% \subsection{Labour supply for production}
We begin with a model of a circular city %- INTRO CITY/APPROACH?
Following the \gls{Alonzo model} \cite{alonzoTheoryUrbanLand1960}, (\cite{alonsoLocationLandUse1964}, firms are located at the centre of a circular city, the central business district. Residents are distributed across space, can take jobs, and commute to work at the center. 
% In the simplest version, firms concentrate at the city centre. Workers are spread over space and pay transportation costs to commute.

Firms produce perfectly \gls{substitutable} goods to sell, % For simplicity, firms produce a variety of  goods, 
which they sell into a commodity market. Demand for the \gls{product} is \gls{perfectly elastic}, so the price remains constant. Firms purchase the time of workers. %to capture the product of their effective labour
%and enjoy the product of \gls{effective labour} . They can produce more goods by hiring additional workers. 

There is an agglomeration effect that augments the productivity of workers: firms can produce more goods with a given stock of labour if the city is larger (the Jacobs effect). Firms can therefore pay a premium because urban workers are more productive than rural workers due to the positive agglomeration externalities. We assume that the neoclassical model of distribution holds in the long run and workers receive the full value of their marginal product (Clark's neoclassical assumption).
%in a city with more people, as introduced in Chapter \ref{chapter-growth} on growth.(**E SEE NOTE HERE) % #E i THINK YOU NEED TO FLESH THIS OUT, i'M NOT SURE EXACTLY WHAT YOU ARE SAYING. JUST BE A BIT MORE SPECIFIC AND FLESH OUT. 
% \subsection{Labour force}
%There are also firms that produce goods to sell. (???) % #E HOW IS THIS DIFFERENT THAN THE FIRMS PRODUCING GOODS IN THE PREVIOUS PARAGRAPH???

% Firms sell the goods they produce into a commodity market. 
 %, which are both exported and locally consumed 
% to sell into a large market, at a fixed price. 

We assume workers receive a \gls{subsistence wage}, $\psi$, in the countryside, which could come from work in the local community, living off the land, family support, social support, or something else.\footnote{Classical economists employed the \gls{subsistence wage} assumption to simplify their analysis in a similar way.}
 The model is set up so that all of an urban  tenant's  income is spent on  basic living costs, $\omega$, transportation $td$ or rent. Disposable income for owner occupier $i$ is therefore just the return  $\omega -dc$ which may accumulate as a financial asset.
To attract workers to live in the city and commute to the central business district, firms pay the  \gls{urban wage premium}, $\omega$, in addition to  the subsistence wage $\psi$. 
%\footnote{See parameter Appendix section \ref{section-wage-premium} for a discussion of the empirical literature on the \gls{urban wage premium}.}. 
% When workers take a job, they give up the subsistence income and, % instead receive a wage from their employer. % When workers take a job, they  receive, in addition to the subsistence wage,  the wage premium  from their employer. 
%Urban workers give up the subsistence income and receive the \gls{urban wage}, which is the subsistence wage plus the urban wage premium $\psi +  \omega$. 
% When we assume an subsistence wage with a specific share  applied to housing we are implicitly assuming that landlords are seeking to claim the value of the rents. It makes it possible to explore whether and how tenants and even owners may be squeezed towards a \gls{subsistence frontier}. %whatever value the can. % tenants are squeezed by landlords. % DOES THE 'THIS' REFER TO THE FORMALIZATION OF WARRANTED RENTS?





% TODO this shows the dynamics of a local economy, trade dynamics dominate local dynamics in many cases, that is explored with the addition of more cities and centres.

The {urban wage premium} and transportation cost together determine both the radius of the circular city and the size of the labour force, %?There is no fixed boundary and the size of the city is determined by the utility that can be achieved in competing regions of competing for labour.
% and as in the standard circular city model the constraint on growth is provided by transportation costs, which limit the size of the commuter-shed and therefore the labour force at any wage. 
 %The raidus of the commuter shed is thus,  %The farthest workers will travel to work is thus 
% The  productivity of the city attracts people. 
since agents will only work if the wage premium is greater than the cost of travel. % Living close to work has value to workers because it saves the cost of transportation. 
The higher the wage, the  farther workers will commute. This is the core of the Alozo circular city model. The farthest workers will travel  is $\frac{w}{{c}}$, where ${c}$ is the cost of transportation per unit distance. This defines the radius of the circular city and the commuter shed.

The \gls{urban labour supply} is an \gls{aggregate} measure that emerges from individual agents' choice to commute. For illustrative purposes, We assume a uniform lot size, $s$, with one worker per unit land, so the labour available in the \gls{circular city} is simply the area of the circle divided by lot size: 
\begin{equation}
%=  \frac{\pi}{s}(c^{max})^2	
 L = \frac{\pi}{s} \left(\frac{w}{{c}}\right)^2
   =\frac{\pi}{{c}^2 s} w^2,
\label{eqn-labour-supply1}
\end{equation}
This is an equilibrium \gls{urban labour supply} curve. It is our version of the standard urban \gls{migration equilibrium}  condition for models of this class, %which is a \cite{GET_migration_equilibOR_pop_equilib_condition}. %It defines the quantity of labour available.
In the base model, we only allow the radius of the city to change, and not the density 
% model rules, and individual 
and firm hiring behaviour\footnote{Complex city form, density patterns, and alternative hiring patterns, can be easily incorporated in the computation model. We expect that they would not significantly affect our conclusions.}. %and the job search process. 
% In practice, many other factors impinge on these choices. %additional decision factors, agents, driving variable, and \gls{stochastic} elements enter the model. %\footnote{See the discussion of model extensions in Appendix \ref{appendix-future-work}.}.
% To get the \gls{urban wage premium}, we can write the inverse of the labour supply function:
% \begin{equation}
% w= (\frac{ {c}^2s}{\pi})^{0.5} L^{0.5}.
% \label{eqn-inverse-labour-supply}
% \end{equation}

\section{Agglomeration}
% *** ADD BACK? To study the productivity of cities, we incorporate Jacobs-style agglomeration economies (\cite{beaudryWhoRightMarshall2009, vanderpanneAgglomerationExternalitiesMarshall2004, jacobsEconomyCities1969}), using an approach similar to the way the \gls{Solow-Swan model} incorporates labour-augmenting technical change with a \gls{Cobb-Douglas} production function, and building the production function into a standard Alonso-style model of an urban economy.
%, using a simple Cobb-Douglas production function. 
% We incorporate the estimated scaling relationship in 
%The scaling result at the level of the city allows us to incorporate the agglomeration effect in a \gls{circular city} model, 

 \Glspl{agglomeration effect} ensure urban \gls{output} is more than proportional to urban population: 
 \begin{equation}
 Y\propto N^{\beta},
 \label{eqn-production-population}
 \end{equation}
where $\beta$ is the elasticity of output with respect to capital,  $\beta >1$.   

According to \gls{neoclassical distribution theory}, the firm maximizes profit by setting the marginal value of the product of each \gls{factor of production} equal to the unit cost per factor. This means the wage premium increases in the same relation to population as \gls{productivity} does:
\begin{equation}
\omega\propto N^{\beta-1}.
\label{eqn-wage-population}
\end{equation}


% The city has single firm facing a fixed price for output. 

% IS THIS DUPLICATION? I THINK THE Solow-Swan model IS INTRODUCED IN SPACE CHAPTER. MOVE THIS TO SPACE CHAPTER IF NEEDED?
% In the \gls{Solow-Swan model}:
% \begin{equation} 
% Y(t) = K(t)^{\alpha}(A(t)L(t))^{\beta}
% \label{Eqn:Solow-Swann}
% \end{equation}
% where $Y$, $K$ and $L$ are aggregate output, capital, and labour, respectively,  $A$ is the term the Solow-Swan model introduced for technology. The technology term capture the growth of labour productivity over time, $\alpha$ is the \gls{elasticity} of output with respect to capital, $\beta$ the elasticity of \gls{output} with respect to \gls{effective labour}, and $t$ time. If $\beta=1-\alpha$, this is a constant returns to scale \gls{CRS} production function at the firm level.
% In the Solow-Swan model all factors of production are fully employed, and initial values $A(0)$, $K(0)$, and $n( 0 )$ are given. The number of workers, i.e. labour, as well as the level of technology grows exogenously at rate %s are $n$ and it   $g$,% respectively:  $L(t)=L(0)e^{nt}$     $A(t)=A(0)e^{gn}$ 
% This model uses a similar functional form to look at the effect of population density increasing % productivity. %how density increases in in  % It models how population increases productivity. 
 
 We are implicitly using a three-factor model of \gls{production}, where production, is a function of capital and labour as well as a third factor, a Solow-Swan style term for labour augmenting technical change, with an \gls{agglomeration} effect, $A(N)$, in place of technology, $A(t)$. Output is:

\begin{equation}
Y=A(N)K^{\alpha }(A(N)N)^\beta.
\label{Eqn:Prod1}
\end{equation}
where $K$ is capital, $\alpha$ is the elasticity of output with respect to capital, $\alpha = \beta - 1$, and  $n$ is the \gls{urban labour supply}. $A(N)$ incorporates Jacob-style agglomeration externalities. $A(N)N$ is \gls{effective labour} \footnote{The function  was discussed in Chapter~\ref{chapter-growth}}. 

% \section{Agglomeration Appendix: Production Function}
% SORT APPENDIX/OTHER STUFF

% WHAT DO WE WANT TO ADD BACK IN/CLARIFY FROM WHAT'S BELLOW? 
% WHAT DO WE WANT TO MOVE TO THE GROWTH CHAPTER OR AN APPENDIX?

% The agglomeration factor increases with population. It multiplies labour because agglomeration scales the productivity of workers.  
% It is a model of a productive urban economy since the centre is productive and demands labour.
% The growth of population feeds back into productivity. % We allow rising population to directly increase the wage.  
% We supplement the spatial model with agglomeration effects consistent with the literature. % in the base model. 
% There is an agglomeration effect, which
% The agglomeration effect means firms can also produce more goods by operating in a city with more people, because of the connections and interactions between people (CITE). 
 
 %, we assume the presence of scaling, consistent with neoclassical growth models as discussed in Chapter \ref{chapter-growth}. 
%In this section, we introduce the basic structure of the production side and connect it to the literature on urban scaling. 
% We bypass the complexity of modelling firms, allowing population increases to directly increase urban wage premium.
%, It is straightforward to compute the rate of excess return for  this model. 

% We assume that the firm behaves as a price taker in the labour market as well, despite the fact that we model it as a \gls{monopsonist}\footnote{}. JUSTIFY/REPHRASE/EXPLAIN monopsonist. %ALSO DOES THIS GO HERE OR BELONG WITH PRIOR SECTION?

% Labour demand is thus a derived demand based on standard neoclassical theory with an equilibrium wage offer that is the marginal (value) product of labour for the firm. Specifically, hiring proceeds until the marginal product of labour is equal to the wage.

% The firm adjusts its labour force upward when the \gls{marginal product of labour} is greater than the wage by selecting from its list of job applicants.
% The firm adjusts its wage offer upward when the marginal product of labour is greater than the wage and it faces a labour shortage.  Labour shortage is a situation where the firm wants to hire but its list of job applicants is empty.

% The marginal product of labour is monotonically declining, ensuring a labour market equilibrium, to connect with the analytic tradition of economic modelling by ensuring there is an equilibrium level of production.  While adding more labour may always adds some value, the rate at which it adds value drops off. 
% If the marginal product increased, then a firm that got large enough would out compete smaller firms, hire all labour, always be able to produce more wealth by hiring more people, and would always produce more wealth by hiring people than by firing people. This doesn't happen. 
% Perhaps, the firm hires employees who best fit its needs first, but to grow, eventually it must hire less selectively. Finding markets may get harder with growth. Perhaps expansion adds additional costs, building a parking lot, administration, acquiring a larger building. Whatever the explanation, the marginal product of labour declines. 

% Frictional unemployment usually just refers to people moving between jobs. When people look for jobs, it may take time to get them. The analytic model offers an equilibrium solution with full employment. In the agent-based model this assumption does not hold, workers are laid off, and take time to find new employment.
% labour adjustment costs include moving costs for the employee or hiring, firing, or training cost for the firm. (there might be a hiring, firing, or training cost on the firm side, or on the employee side: expected time to employment costs, moving costs, etc.)
% The assumption of monotonically embedded marginal product of labour is embedded in the production function, so it applies in the analytic and agent models. This appears in the requirement that the sum of the exponents in the \gls{Cobb-Douglas} are less than one without agglomeration effects. Agglomeration effects can push the sum above one. When the exponents add up to less than one, there are diminishing returns to scale.  Exploring alternatives would involved exploring other formulations of the production function.

% $mvp(x) = p(x)$ where x can be labour, capital or any other factor, falls out of the function when you introduce profit maximization. Continuity and differentiability assumed but it is a convenient approximation-- take away assumptions you typically get a close approximation.

% We have a two factor model of production with labour and capital.  

\section{Financialization}
%Our goal is to look at the relationship between urban production/labour markets, agglomeration, and land/housing markets. To explore this relationship we build a simplified model of a \gls{housing market}.% CALL IT LAND, PROPERTY, OR HOUSING MARKET? % - it is the housing use, combined with location we're interested in. % we introduce a \gls{land market}.% Agents purchase homes though a housing market. 

In practice, housing is exchanged on a market. The product is properties %, at a particular location, which include
whether they're apartments, or land with the buildings on it. Properties have features including building size, style, quality, and location %, and even neighbourhood features 
that affect their desirability. %the buildings have a particular size and characteristics. %with various buildings and features. %properties on them. 
%Location also matters, %Land value  is affected by various elements
%including proximity to natural features like lakes and mountains, and human-built features like communities, and businesses, as well a developments and additions on the property itself. 
%Thereal market invovles  a set of agents who engage directly like buyers, sellers, renters, investors, and developers; as well as others who shape the market indirectly, including policymakers, activists, and neighbourhood and industry groups.
%The actors work within the context of a layer of policy, institutions, and rules. For example financial institutions offer debt, zoning allows certain uses and disallows others, and tax rules shape financial returns.

% Other factors also shape prices, including \gls{amenity}.

% *** In the model, rising \gls{population} and \gls{productivity} generate an economic value for land, that's derived from its proximity to the \gls{urban center}. 

% Use of a unit of land in each cycle is valued at the wage premium net of transportation costs. 
 % A worker, located at a distance $d$ from work, paying as much as $w- {dc}$ in rent, would still choose to work.

%\subsection{The microeconomics of  financialization}\label{section-micro}

Financialization happens at this microeconomic level, where individual decisions are made and  real assets are bought by individuals and institutions. Individual home-buyers are buying a stream of housing services and possible capital gains. Institutional buyers are buying a stream of net rents plus speculative gains. Each agent has their own interest rates, discount rates, mortgage share, information, and expectations, so individual bids can differ.

%In the process, the real asset takes on an additional and separate aspect as financial object that can be bought and sold. 

The feature that matters most to investors is the  \gls{rate of return} that  an asset offers. For any level of risk and liquidity, an investor will choose to purchase the asset with the highest rate of return. When a home is bought to live in, the potential buyer makes a similar calculation, perhaps with a greater emphasis on the value of the stream of housing services. When home prices are rising rapidly speculative gains may become the dominant concern of home buyers. 

To model the investment decision  we therefore need to calculate the \gls{rate of return} on each property taking into account the rental revenue, the potential capital gain, the investors' costs of capital, incomes, and assets. The analysis will show the incentive structure driving the  financialization of the housing market. We do this in detail in Appendix~\ref{appendix-bid-price} 
The model must  allow for bidding and speculative investment but also must reflect the underlying economic value driven by urban productivity. To calculate the \gls{rate of return} we, therefore, need to define  the relevant variables, and make some distinctions among different notions  of rent and price %, including a variety of prices perceived prices  bid price3s
\subsection {Variables}

\subsubsection{Rent} \label{sec-Rent}
The explicit treatment of rents and the relationship between the productivity \gls{premium} and the \gls{subsistence wage}
is also what makes this a ``\gls{classical}'' model.

% There are three pieces to this analysis - there's the warranted price based on the underlying economic value of living in a property, the link here with urban productivity, there's the biding and negotiation process, and then there's the realized market price. 


To develop the analysis, we have to keep track of a number of different quantities, outlined in Table \ref{table-price-notation}\footnote{In the table, we include indices for agent $i$ and property $j$, for clarity. In the following development we'll only use the subscripts where needed to distinguish between agents and properties.}. 

In the model, agents learn or set these values with the support of a real estate agent, and based on information provided by their bank about lending rates, etc. After setting prices, agents engage in a negotiation process. 

The link with urban productivity is made through the land rents distributed through wages and available for distribution. If agents own their own property, they capture the rents. If others own it, they capture the rents.


\subsubsection{Economic rent}\label{sssec-economic-rent}
The economic rent is the value of the locational services, 
This is a surplus that arise from agglomeration economies that make being close to the city core valuable. \Gls{locational services} are represented as %, on an annual basis, 
the wage premium, $w$, minus the transportation costs, $c$, for a property a given distance, $d$, from the center. That is the value of living in a particular location:
\[\omega- {dc}.\]


\subsubsection{Warranted rent}\label{sssec-waranted-rent}

%Just as there is a warranted price, there  is 
The economically \gls{warranted rent}, $\mathcal{R}_W$, is the value of all  the services a property offers. % and \gls{market rent}, $\mathcal{R}_M$. The {warranted rent} 
It is the maximum rent  a tenant might pay in rent, since it is the maximum that could be extracted from tenants before they decide they are better off leaving the city.  

In each period a house offers two kinds of services: {locational services} or  access to the central city job, and {home services}.  The {warranted rent} is the value of this double stream of services.  The value of the stream of housing services is the fraction $a$ of the subsistence wage $\psi$ that must be allocated to providing the housing independent of location. 

 The warranted rent is, then, 
\begin{align}
\mathcal{R}_W=\omega- {dc} + a\psi.
\label{eqn-warranted-rent}
\end{align}
 It a kind of limit or \gls{frontier} the market pushes agents towards. It may be thought of as an \gls{equilibrium} or \gls{attractor}. The way this work uses that kind of frontier, drawing on \gls{equilibrium}, \gls{dynamical system}, and \gls{agent-based} traditions of analysis, is treated in detail in the discussion of methodology in Chapter \ref{chapter-methodology}.

 We anchor our housing price expectations in warranted rents, which, based on the literature can reasonably be seen as an equilibrium or attractor towards which prices will evolve. 

 
\subsubsection{Market rent}\label{Market-Rent}
The \gls{market rent}, $\mathcal{R}_M$, is what agents actually pay. The market rent can in principle differ from the economically warranted rent as individual investors make decisions about rents and setting rents based on their own expectations, which include a wide range of factors. To simplify the model, we assume that the market rent equals the warranted rent. We are in effect imposing a long-term equilibrium value rather than modeling the adjustment process.  %\gls{warranted rent} is paid as the \gls{market rent}
\[\mathcal{R}_M = \mathcal{R}_W.\] 


\subsubsection{Net rent}\label{Net-Rent}
The \gls{net rent} is the warranted rent net of costs. Homes must be maintained and taxes paid, so an owner would receive, not the total warranted rent, but the net rent after expenses,

\begin{align}

where $\mathcal{O}$ is operating costs and $\mathcal{T}$ is taxes.

\subsubsection{Annual taxation}

%For computational purposes, we will assume that, that is the warranted price.  
 % assessed value
One cost owners pay on a property is taxes. Municipal property taxes are based on the \gls{appraised value}, which is based, somewhat approximately and with a lag, on the \gls{market price}, $\mathcal{P}_M$. % The appraised value typically lags the market value, and attempts to approximate underlying value, so we approximate it here it with the \gls{warranted price} \cite{apraised_value_refs}. 

\begin{align*}
\mathcal{T} &= \text{mill rate} \times \mathcal{P}_M \\
\end{align*}
where the `\gls{mill rate}' is the municipal tax rate $c$ applied to the Market price.\footnote{In our computations, the mill rate  has to be compounded for decisions made over a period of the mortgage term, so we compound the mill rate $c$ using the the \gls{compound interest rate} for the period. The entirely conventional  computation is described below.} The taxes paid over the period are then:

\subsubsection{Annual maintenance}
Annual maintenance costs apply to buildings and lands but not to locational value,
so we can write
 \begin{align}
\mathcal{R}_N^w &= \omega - {dc}  + a\psi -   ba\psi - c(\omega-{dc}+a\psi) \\
\end{align}

\subsubsection{Warranted price}\label{sssec-warranted-price}

We will call the economically justified price, given the urban productivity premium, the \gls{warranted price}, 
The \gls{warranted price} of a house is the present discounted value of the flow of service net of costs: $P_W$. This is the present discounted value of the warranted rents.
\begin{equation}
  P_W=\frac{\mathcal{R}_N}{r},  
\label{eqn-price-warranted}
\end{equation}
where $\mathcal{R}_N$ is the net value of rents, and $r$ is the interest rate.  The warranted price approximates the sale price, of a unit of housing with land, in the absence of potential capital gains. 

We will assume that the market price can be approximated by the present discounted value of warranted  rents.  We can therefore write taxes

\begin{align*}
\mathcal{T} &= \text{mill rate} \times \frac{\mathcal{R}_W}{r} \\
&= c \times \frac{\omega- {dc} + a\psi.}{r}
\end{align*}


The rate of price growth $\dot P$, is an approximation based on rents and past market behaviour.

\subsubsection{Market price and expected price}\label{sssec-market-price}

The actual market price will be determined by a bidding process that takes into account potential capital gains.  We describe the bid price formulation below. The \gls{market price} or the price at which a property is exchanged on the market, $P_M$ will not be known in advance, nor will the future sale price. In order to make decisions, agent $i$ must form an  \glspl{expectation} or   prediction $P_{M_i}^{\epsilon}$ of an as yet unrealized future market price. Agent $i$'s expected market price  may be affected by individual information, biases, preferences, and any assumptions the agent has about the behaviour of others, the system state. The rate of price growth $\dot P$, is also an approximation based on rents and past market behaviour.\footnote{Since  agents do not have perfect information, the expected value  is calculated with their best approximation of values.} 
 \footnote{Case and Shiller ``..we see a market largely driven by expectations. People seem to form their expectations from past price movements rather than having any knowledge of fundamentals. This means that housing price booms will persist as home buyers become destabilizing speculators.''Case and Schiller, \cite{caseThereBubbleHousing2003}} 

%$P_M^{e}$ expectation based on  either rational expectations or another set of explicitly stated rules,  $P_M^{\epsilon}$ is an agent's expectation. The agent's expectation can  etc.



%In the analysis that follows, we work with an \gls{expected market price} based on the theoretical model developed in this dissertation, $P_M^{e}$.


Instead of modelling the rental price formation process explicitly, we abstract from the complexities  of market rent  by using the warranted rent as an approximation. We do this to focus on the economic rent, and to show as clearly and as simply as possible the economic linkages between productivity and urban rents. 
The assumption simplifies the analysis of the relationship between the scaling of urban productivity and the financialized ownership that can extract that value which is part of  the core conceptual contribution of this work.

% $L(p)$

% $p$ is all the price data plus any exogenous information (e.g. policy knowledge?). $L(p)$ is an estimation function that produces a `common knowledge' value for the rate of price increase. Later you can add idiosyncratic extra knowledge or extra ignorance.

%and the potential for financialized ownership to extract that value, pushing those who contribute to creating growing wealth, to a subsistence frontier.

In the computational agent-based  model, the assumption gives a natural way to initialize agent guesses about future rents, as part of the \gls{price formation} process. The values evolve from that starting point.

%\footnote{The assumption $\mathcal{R}_W = \mathcal{R}_M$ is easy to vary in future experiments, 
% Rents can diverge from warranted rents. In practice, some people may pay more or less than the warranted rent.

WHERE DO WE MAKE THAT ASSUMPTION.
%including by adding a range of decision rules. 
% Our model of income is incomplete, and people don't only care about the income they earn. Some are paying for the amenity of urban life. In real life, many other factors cans shape amenity value including features of the housing, desire to live near clubs, sports, cafe's libraries, hospitals, neighbours, and family members, the quality of nearby walk, of transit to places they may wish to travel to etc. Appendix \ref{appendix-amenity} includes a theoretical treatment of amenity in the context of the model.

% \subsubsection{Locational services}
% Since people live in homes inside or outside the city, it's a share of the subsistence wage,  OWNERS CAN ALSO CAPTURE? Maybe move some of the discussion here.

% It is the combined annual services a property, at a distance $d$, offers to a worker in the city. It is thus the maximum that they may be charged.
% CUT? This quantity is a locational rent. The capitalized value of the locational rent is:  $w-{dc}$. This is because a worker, located at a distance $d$ from work, paying as much as $w-{dc}$ in rent would still choose to work.  %Workers could pay that much in rent and additional costs and it would still worthwhile to commute. 
% \subsubsection{Land and building services}
% Annual rent charged initially should be  equal to the annual value of services, $h$:
% and the warranted price is 
% \[P_W=\frac{\omega - {dc} + a\psi}{r}\]
% We will use this value as the price for the first period 
% $P_W=\frac{\omega- {dc} + a\psi}{r}$

%$\mathcal{R}_N$ is the value that investors consider when assessing the \gls{financial return} on property, since it's the maximum that it's worth paying to capture the value renters are wiling to pay to live in a property, given the \gls{urban wage premium}.

% For an investor, it is $\mathcal{R}_N$  that is relevant in investment decisions. % ( - fees, cost of money etc.) decision making. 

% All of these are in annual values. We will use the present values  for the appropriate period  T in computations. (See notes on the present value calculations to use)

% \subsection{NEW WORK STARTS - How does this affect the bid price?}

% I now return to Equations B6 to compute the value of a proposed purchase


% \begin{align*}
% V &= \delta \left(P_T - (1+r)M\right) +      \mathcal{R}^w_N  \tag{B6} \\
%   &= \delta \left((1+\dot P)    - (1+r)m    \right) P_B + \mathcal{R}^w_N%\label{eqn-property-investment-value1}
% \end{align*}
% Similarly, Equation B7 becomes

% \begin{align*}
% r_{return} = \frac{\delta \left(1 + \dot P - (1+r)m\right)}{1-m} + \frac{\mathcal{R}^w_N}{(1-m)^{bid}}\tag{B7}
% \end{align*}
% And following the same sequence of steps to derive the bid price 

% \begin{align*}
% P_i^{bid} \le &   \frac{\mathcal{R}^w_N}{(1-m_i)r_i^{target} - \delta_i \left(1 + L(P) - (1+r_i)m_i \right)} \tag{B10}\\
% 		 \le &   \frac{ \omega - dc + a\psi -   ba\psi - ca\psi}{(1-m_i)r_i^{target} - \delta_i \left(1 + L(P) - (1+r_i)m_i \right)}	\\	
%    		 \le &   \frac{ \omega - dc + a(1-b-c)\psi}{(1-m_i)r_i^{target} - \delta_i \left(1 + L(P) - (1+r_i)m_i \right)}	
% \end{align*}

%Our conclusion about the advantage that the bank and the wealthy have can be read out of this equation. 
%That may let us simplify the exposition in the financialization chapter.


\section{Bid Price}
To model the market transactions when speculative motives are in play we need an expression for how much financial investors will bid. More specifically, we need to find the maximum price that they are willing to pay. 
%As Horowitz \cite{horowitzBiddingModelsHousing1986} notes, a prospective buyer  considering knows a vector of attributes of the house, the seller’s asking price and the property taxes, transaction costs, and financing costs at a specified price. The  potential buyer also is likely to have estimates of the maintenance costs and resale value of the house, although these may be highly subjective. 
%All of these factors are taken into account  to determine whether an investment is profitable. To make a comparison with alternative investments  it is necessary to compute a rate of return. 


We first calculate the net present value of the purchase, then divide by the amount of capital employed, which we assume is simply the size of the down payment made at the beginning of the period. This gives us a rate of return.\footnote{A common approach would be to calculate an internal rate of return (IRR), but  the IRR is in general the solution to a polynomial and does not guarantee a single-valued result.\cite{robinsonOPTIMALTERMINATIONIRR1996} Multiple real-valued  IRRs may arise;  complex-valued IRRs may arise;  the IRR is, in general, incompatible with the net present value (NPV) in accept/reject decisions; the IRR ranking is, in general, different from the NPV ranking; the IRR criterion is not applicable with variable costs of capital. Ways to salvage the IRR as a usable criterion have been proposed that are consistent with our approach \cite{magniAverageInternalRate2010}, which is to calculate an NPV then convert it to a rate,} 
The rate of return on the investment must exceed some required rate of return. This condition allows us to calculate the maximum price that will satisfy that criterion.



% MOVE THIS
% The underlying value of a home is the capitalized value of the services it provides, which are perpetual.  Rents, however, depend on urban productivity and may change over time. Any expected increase in future rents capitalized into the market price of a home as a capital gain for the owner. Home prices should respond to expectations.

%We link the housing market model model of individual and institutional actors to the model of production and employment by..
%Rents go to the owners of a given property. If workers own their own homes, rents go to them. If others own the land, they can extract the rent.

% We assume that agent may be  speculating on potential \glspl{capital gain} as well as on the \gls{use value} or net market rent they get from the property. We therefore treat the purchase as an investment decision and compute a rate of return, $v$, conditional on the price paid. This allows us to solve for the maximum bid, $P_{max}^{bid}$ that achieves the desired rate of return. 
    
 The agent purchases makes a down payment, $D$ on a house for a price, $P_M$, and agrees to payoff a mortgage, $M$ with interest at the end of the mortgage period. For expositional convenience, we can treat the mortgage period $T$ as a single term and express all quantities  in present-value terms. The purchaser 
 receives the increased price $P_T = (1 + \dot P)P_0$,  after a period $T$, Where $\dot P$ is the expected rate of price increase. The agent also receives either the net market rental value of the property throughout the period, $\mathcal{R}_N$, or if the owner is also the resident, the locational rents.

\subsection{Prime interest rate}\label{SS:BankRate}

The bank's interest rate, $r$, is just the bank rate (prime rate? set by the Bank of Canada. Exogenous. Just assign  a value like 4\%.

\subsection{Wealth constraint on m} \label{SS:WealthConstraint}

According to the Canada Housing Statistics Program (CHSP), first-time home buyers require a combination of sufficient income and savings in order to enter the housing market. (insert tables? from the CHSP?) We have implemented these facts by making interest rates and mortgage share depend on income and wealth.
We can define individual wealth as:
\[W_i= P_i -M_i  +S_i\]
where 

\begin{tabular}{ll}
$P_i$ & value of owned home\\
$M_i$ & Mortgage on owned home\\
$S_i$ & personal savings = $age*d*W$\\
\end{tabular}

The availability of capital differs for rich and poor. 

The borrowing ratikon, $m$ is the fraction of a propewerty 's pricxe that can be mortgaged.: $m=M/p_M$. We can develop an expression to capture the relationship between the \gls{borrowing ratio}, $m_i$,  and individual wealth. Figure~\ref{Fig:Borrowingratio} illustrates a plausible mortgage availability  model that is written:

 \[ m_i = 9-\left(\frac{W_i}{\bar W}\right)^{0.1} \]

 
Where $\bar{W}$ is mean wealth and $W_i$ is individual wealth. 
The relationship is clearly established empirically \cite{}, but location and shape of the curve may vary somewhat. The curve is parameterized, here, so that the bank has a borrowing ratio close to one, perhaps 0.9, since it has many assets. The borrowing ratio for the median wealth holder, perhaps 0.8.

\subsubsection{Individualized borrowing rates}\label{SS:BorowingRate}

% \label{Fig:Borrowingrate2}
% \end{figure}

% The rates $\delta,\ \sigma,$ and $r$ depend on the period, $T$. 


 
\subsubsection{Mortgage availability}\label{sssec-mortgage-availability}
The borrowing of most agents will be constrained. A common rule is that mortgage payments cannot exceed some fraction of disposable income. The wealthy will be able borrow larger amounts and at lower interest rates than the less wealthy.

Many personal finance experts recommend total housing costs account for less than 28\% of \textbf{gross} household income, This gives us an \textbf{income-based  mortgage maximum} of \[M^{max}_Yi = \frac{0.28*(\omega+w)}{r_i}\] It is the maximum the bank will let you pay.

We assume $r_i$ is based on the individual's assets, on relative wealth. Where is it calculated for the householder or the bank?

We also have  a \textbf{price-based mortgage maximum} \[M^{max}_P = 0.8P_0\] where $P_0$ is the actual sale price. This is based on the maximum amount of risk that the bank is willing to take on. Combining tyhese conditions, %($P_0$  will not always be the same as the asking price or the warranted price.)

\[M^{max}_Yi = min\left\{\frac{0.28*(\omega+w)}{r_i},  0.8P_0 \right\} \]


% \subsection{The cost of capital}
% The cost of capital is known to differ for rich and poor. This model ties the individual cost of capital,  $r_i$ for agent $i$, to a prime rate, $\bar r$, and to individual wealth. Figure~\ref{Fig:BorrowingCost} illustrates the cost of the borrowing model we implement, 
%  \[ r_i = (A + B \frac{\bar{W}}{W_i})\omega\]
% Where $\bar{W}$ is mean wealth and $W_i$ is individual wealth. 
% \begin{figure}[!hb]

% \label{Fig:CapitalCost}
% \end{center}
% \end{figure}
If the expected return on a property is greater than the individual cost of borrowing, it would pay any agent to borrow as much as possible and purchase properties as they can available.\footnote{As pointed out previously,  Equation~\ref{Eqn:DecisionRule} implies a `bang-bang' control - with all sales going to the richest participant unless there are limits on the size of capital flows. For our simulation, we implement such limits. } 
 




 \subsection{The value of an investment}
The value of the investment $V$ is therefore the capital gain, minus financing costs, plus the rents, net of operating costs and taxes, $\mathcal{R}_N$.
 
 This may be written in terms of the purchase price, and several individual parameters: interest  rate, share of the price that can be mortgaged and  discount rate:\footnote{The down payment could be deducted in advance, but if the discount rate is equal to the interest rate it drops out completely.}
 
\begin{align}
V &= \delta \left(P_T - (1+r)M\right) +   \mathcal{R}^w_N   \\
&= \delta \left((1+\dot P) P_0 - (1+r)mP_M\right)  +      \mathcal{R}^w_N \\
%V &=& \delta \left(P_T - (1+r)M\right) +  \mathcal{R}^w_N\\
  &= \delta \left((1+\dot P)    - (1+r)m    \right) P_M + \mathcal{R}^w_N 
\end{align}
This is the net present value of buying, and selling after one planning period. All rates are scaled to the length of the period to avoid the need for compounding calculations. The function has 4 individualized  parameters, $\delta$, $\dot p$, $r$, $m$, as well as any factors that affect the rent term.


\subsubsection{Rate of return on investment}
Since an investor is interested in the rate of return on funds invested, we divide V by the size of the down payment, $D$ to get the required rate of return  

\begin{align}
r^{return} 
  &= \frac{V}{D}  \nonumber \\
  &= \left(\delta \left(1+\dot P - (1+r)m\right) \ \right) \frac{P_0}{D}  + \frac{\mathcal{R}^w_N }{D}      \nonumber \\
  &= \left(\delta \left(1+\dot P - (1+r)m\right)  \right) \frac{P_0}{P_0-mP_0} +  \frac{\mathcal{R}^w_N }{P_0-mP_0}  \\ 
  &= \frac{\delta \left(1+\dot P - (1+r)m\right) }{1-m} +\frac{\mathcal{R}^w_N }{(1-m)P_0}.
\label{eqn-property-investment-return1}
\end{align}


\subsubsection{Criterion for investment}
Equation~\ref{eqn-property-investment-return1} provides a criterion for investors. Agents invest if  their expected return is greater than the target return, they are seeking:
\begin{equation}
r^{target}\le r^{return} 
\label{eqn-property-investment-return2}
\end{equation}
% \subsection{Rate of return on investment}% The rate of return on funds invested is V divided by the size of the down payment, $D$ to get the rate of return  
%
% \begin{align}
% r^{return} 
%   &= \frac{V}{D}  \nonumber \\
%   &= \left(\delta \left(1+\dot P - (1+r)m\right) \ \right) \frac{P_0}{D}  + \frac{\mathcal{R}^w_N }{D}      \nonumber \\
%   &= \left(\delta \left(1+\dot P - (1+r)m\right)  \right) \frac{P_0}{P_0-mP_0} +  \frac{\mathcal{R}^w_N }{P_0-mP_0}  \\ 
%   &= \frac{\delta \left(1+\dot P - (1+r)m\right) }{1-m} +\frac{\mathcal{R}^w_N }{(1-m)P_0}.

%
% \subsection{Criterion for investment}
% Equation~\ref{eqn-property-investment-return1} provides a criterion for investors. Agents invest if if their expected return is greater than the target return, they are seeking:
% \begin{equation}\Large
% r^{target}\le v 
% \label{eqn-property-investment-return2}
% \end{equation}
% 
% We first calculate the net present value of the purchase, then divide by the amount of capital employed, which we assume is simply the size of the down payment made at the beginning of the period. This gives us a rate of return.\footnote{A common approach would be to calculate an internal rate of return (IRR), but  the IRR is in general the solution to a polynomial and does not guarantee a single-valued result.\cite{robinsonOPTIMALTERMINATIONIRR1996} Multiple real-valued  IRRs may arise;  complex-valued IRRs may arise;  the IRR is, in general, incompatible with the net present value (NPV) in accept/reject decisions; the IRR ranking is, in general, different from the NPV ranking; the IRR criterion is not applicable with variable costs of capital. Ways to salvage the IRR as a usable criterion have been proposed that are consistent with our approach \cite{magniAverageInternalRate2010}, which is to calculate an NPV then convert it to a rate,} 
% 
% \begin{eqnarray}
% Rate\ of\ return\ on\ capital\ invested = \frac{\delta \left((1+ \dot P_M^e - (1+r)m\right)}{1-m} + \frac{\mathcal{R}_N}{(1-m)P_B}\label{equation-RoR}
% \end{eqnarray}
% where 
% 
% \begin{tabular}{lll}
%  $\delta$       &=& individual discount rate \\
% $\dot P_M^e $   &=& expected rate of price increase \\
% $ r$            &=& mortgage interest rate \\
% $m$             &=&  fraction of the price that can be mortgaged \\
% $\mathcal{R}_N$ &=&  net  market rent
% \end{tabular}
% Equation~\ref{equation-RoR} makes it clear that the estimated rate of return depends on subjective magnitudes,$\delta$ and $\dot P_M^e$, attributes of the property, $ \mathcal{R}_N$, and  individual financial position, $r$, $m$.
% 
% The individual's Rate of return on capital  invested  for each project  is compared to the investor's target rate, $r_{target}$, providing  an investment criterion:
% \begin{eqnarray}
% r_{target} \le \frac{\delta \left((1+ \dot P_M^e - (1+r)m\right)}{1-m} + \frac{\mathcal{R}_N}{(1-m)P_B}
% \end{eqnarray}
% In Appendix~\ref{appendix-bid-price} this expression is solved for $P_B$, the  maximum price that allows the investor can pay and still achieve at least her  target rate of return, $r_{target}$.  

\subsubsection{Maximum bids}
The maximum price in Equation~\ref{eqn-property-investment-return1} that the investor can price offer for the property  and still satisfy the inequality~\ref{eqn-property-investment-return2} $P_B^{max}$ is

\begin{eqnarray}
P_B^{max} & \le    \frac{\mathcal{R}_N}{(1-m)r^{target}-\delta \left(1 + \dot P_M^e - (1+r)m\right)} \label{equation-Bidprice}\end{eqnarray}
% P_B & \le    \frac{\mathcal{R}_N}{(1-m)r^{target}-\left[ \delta(1+L(P)- (1+r)m\right]}
We call this  $i's$ maximum bid and compute it for all potential buyers and sellers. In each sale the highest $P_B$ will make the purchase. The denominator can be seen as an adjusted rate of return for capitalizing net rents, analogous to the value of $r$ in  the standard capitalization formula.

Buyers will not initially bid the maximum and sellers will generally set an asking price $P^{ask}$ higher than their reservation price $P_R$, so we build a simple bargaining process.



\subsubsection{Reservation price}\label{sssec-reservation-price}

We will assume,  that for owners, deciding to sell is a life-cycle decision: home owners-workers  reach the end of their working lives, no longer need access to the central city, and put their homes on the market, making room for new workers to enter the urban market.\footnote{The timing decision can be randomized, but that is highly unlikely to affect results.} \footnote{Worker-owners remain in their homes after retirement. In that case,  there would be fewer homes available for new workers, which must produce a labour shortage in this model, driving up wages, and leading to higher bids and rising home prices, which in turn attracts  speculative bidding. This will only accelerate any shift in the ownership pattern. Our core model suppresses labour market dynamics and the effect of housing shortages to focus on the warranted prices, which are driven by aggregation economies.} 
\footnote{We could allow potential buyers  to approach potential sellers who have not listed with an offer and allow worker-owners to consider retiring early or becoming tenants if an offer is attractive.  This is only likely if speculative pressures are strong. It may require having multiple institutional buyers to make offers more competitive. In that case, initial offers will be closer to the maximum bid price, tending to pull prices up and benefit potential sellers.}  
\footnote{As a further  extension, worker-owners in the final few years of their working life might decide to  list if  they notice that the expected price posted by the real estate agent, $P_M^e$,  exceeds (say) 95\% of their reservation price. This is a `hopeful' listing, `fishing' for an offer that exceeds the actual reservation price.}

% \[P^{ask}>P_M^e> 0.95 P^r\]
% Otherwise
% \[P^{ask}> 1.10P^r>P_M^e\]
% If no offer exceeds the reservation price, no sale is made.

Once an owner reached retirement age, if no sale is made the reservation price is reduced for the next cycle.

If no sale is made the owner considers becoming a landlord. if the present value of net rent is above the reservation price, the owner rents out the home. 


\section{The bargaining model}\label{sec-bargaining}
The bargaining  mechanism then simply has to compare the maximum bid price  $P_B$ with the seller's reservation price. If the $P_B^{max}>P_R$, a deal that is between the two values is possible. Otherwise, the transaction does not proceed.

We then check the initial bids and the asking price and apply a bargaining rule to determine how any surplus $P_B^{max}-P_R$is allocated. The details of the bargaining rule will have little or no effect on the  behaviour of the system. 

If the posted asking price is above $P_B^{max}$, the potential buyer  makes an offer below $P_B^{max}$ and the bargaining rule selects a value between the offer and the ask that is less than $P_B^{max}$, say min($0.5(P^{offer}+P^{ask}), P_B^{max})$.

If the posted asking price is below $P_B^{max}$, the potential buyer  makes an offer below $P^{ask}$ and the bargaining rule selects a value between the offer and the ask that is above $P_R$, say max($0.5(P^{offer}+P^{ask}), P_R)$. 

If there  are competing buyers, the second highest max bid should be the sale price, but the bidder with the highest max bid wins the property. This is realistic because in a bidding war the final bid only has to be a very small amount higher than that of the last competitor left.  That is the highest price that a seller can normally get.\footnote{This is an application of Vickrey, or second price, auction theory. Bidders are asked to submit sealed bids b1, ..., bn. The bidder who submits the highest bid is awarded the object, and pays the amount of the second highest bid.\cite{levinAuctionTheory2004} }

%Agents borrow a share of the purchase price, $P$. The amount borrowed is the mortgage, $M$. This is a share of the total purchase price $mP = M$. The \gls{mortgage term}, $T$, is the period it takes to pay down the mortgage.

%\section{Return on investment}

% The rate of return on funds invested, $r_{return}$, is the value divided by the size of the down payment, $D$: 
% %The rate of return is $v = \frac{V}{D}$. %For expat investors, we get a \textbf{decision rule}:
% %\begin{enumerate}
% %\item  if $v \geq a$ (with some private use?) with no rent,  don't bother renting. 
% %\item If $v(no\ rent\ and\ tax) < a\geq v(with\ rent)$,  then  rent. 
% %\item If $ v(with\ rent) \le a $,  then sell 
% %\end{enumerate}\
% \begin{eqnarray}
% r^{return} 
%   &=& \frac{V}{D}  \nonumber \\
%   &=& \left(\delta \left(1+\dot P - (1+r)m\right) \ + \rho - \theta - \tau \right) \frac{P_0}{D}        \nonumber \\
%   &=& \left(\delta \left(1+\dot P - (1+r)m\right) \ + \rho - \theta - \tau \right) \frac{P_0}{P_0-mP_0} \nonumber \\ 
%   &=& \frac{\delta \left(1+\dot P - (1+r)m\right) \ + \rho - \theta - \tau }{1-m}.
% \label{eqn-property-investment-return1}
% \end{eqnarray}
% Equation~\ref{eqn-property-investment-return1} provides a criterion for investors. Agents invest if if their expected return is greater than the target return, they are seeking:
% \begin{equation}
% r^{return} \geq r^{target}. 
% \label{eqn-property-investment-return2}
% \end{equation}

%This is the maximum price that satisfies the criterion $r^{return} \geq r^{target}$.  The bid price is used in the price determination process in our model. %Where the return is the value over the down payment:
% Equation \ref{eqn-property-investment-return1} expresses the expected return on investment in terms of the  market price, $P_0$: 
% \begin{eqnarray*}
%  r^{return} 
%    &=& \frac{V}{D} \\
%    &=& \frac{\delta \left(1+\dot P - (1+r)m\right) \ + \rho - \theta - \tau}{1-m}.
% \end{eqnarray*}
%which we define as the ``bid price'',% $P_B$ $P^{max}_{bid}$. 
%We return to Equation~\ref{eqn-property-investment-value3} %
%We start by writing the value of the investment, from Equation \ref{eqn-property-investment-value1}, with the net rent. %, which can be written a share, $\phi$ of total rent $\mathcal{R}_N = \phi \mathcal{R}$, %The net rent can also be written as a share, $\phi$, of the rent 
%: %(originally from Chapter \ref{chapter-financialization} on Financialization. Since the rent is a known quantity at the beginning of the term, independent of the current, so we reformulate net rent,  $\mathcal{R}$, $\mathcal{O}$, $\mathcal{T}$ as a fraction of total rent: 

% \begin{eqnarray}
% V &=& \delta \left(P_T - (1+r)M\right) +      \mathcal{R}_N   \nonumber \\
%   % &=& \delta \left(P_T - (1+r)M\right) + \mathcal{R}_N   \nonumber \\

%   &=& \delta \left((1+\dot P)P_0 - (1+r)m P_0\right)     + \mathcal{R}_N \nonumber \\
%   &=& \delta \left((1+\dot P)    - (1+r)m    \right) P_0 + \mathcal{R}_N
% \label{eqn-property-investment-value3}
% \end{eqnarray}


% Dividing by the down payment, $D = (1-m)P_0$:
% \begin{eqnarray}
% r_{return} = \frac{\delta \left(1 + \dot P - (1+r)m\right)}{1-m} + \frac{\mathcal{R}_N}{(1-m)P_0}
% \end{eqnarray}

% +++++++++++++++ JUST REPLACED BETWEEN THESE WITH THE ABOVE. CHECK IT'S OKAY
% % We also have to assume that $P_B = P_M$, which we can justify as an equilibrium condition - investors believe they are paying the market price. The result is 
% % \[V= \delta(P^T- (1+r)M)   +\phi r P_B\]

% % The price at the end of the term $T$, $P_T$, is a predicted value for the investor \textit{ex-ante}, so we can replace $P^T$ in Equation~\ref{eqn-property-investment-value3} with the predictor, $(1+\dot P)P_B$. 
% % We can replace $P^T$ in Equation~\ref{eqn-property-investment-value3} with $(1+\dot P)P_0$.
% \[V= \delta \left((1+\dot P)P_0 - (1+r)m P_0\right) +\phi \mathcal{R}\] 
% Then we replace $\dot P$ with an estimate, $L(P)$, representing an estimated function of the lagged values of $P$ and any  other relevant data. We imagine the potential investor informed estimates by information from  real estate agents or analysts.  The result is 
% \[V= \delta \left((1+L(P))P_B- (1+r)mP_B\right) +\phi \mathcal{R}\]
% Combining terms:
% \[V= \delta \left((1+L(P))- (1+r)m \right) P_B +\phi \mathcal{R}\]

% WHY BIG BRACKETS NOT SHOWING UP

% The rate of return $r_{return}=V/D=V/(1-m)P_B$ is then

% \[r_{return}= \frac{\delta \left((1+L(P) - (1+r)m\right)}{1-m} + \frac{\phi \mathcal{R}}{(1-m)P_B}\]

% \end{eqnarray}

% \subsection{Maximum bid} % given the rate of return

% Agents bid if the RHS is larger than the target rate of return, as stated in Equation \ref{eqn-property-investment-return2}.  $P_0$ with $P_B$, and $\dot P$ with an estimator for $\dot P$, we get: %TO DO REPLACE PDOT - MAYBE WITH TILDE AND DOT..:

% Replace $P^T$ with $(1+\dot P)P_B$ assuming that the bidder is bidding the equilibrium market price for the period.

% Then replace   $\dot P$ with $L(p)$ representing some (estimated function ($\tilde{\dot P}$)) of the lagged values of $P$ that incorporates other data. 

% \begin{eqnarray}
% v&=& \delta(P^T- (1+r)M) \qquad \qquad \qquad 	 + \mathcal{R}_N \nonumber\\
%  &=&\delta\left( (1+\dot P)P_B - (1+r)mP_B \right)  + \mathcal{R}_N  \nonumber\\
%   &=&\delta\left( (1+L(p)) - (1+r)m \right) P_B + \mathcal{R}_N  \nonumber
% \end{eqnarray}

% So I want to use this relationship to find the maximum bid price for the bank. The rule is, ``Bid if the RHS is larger than the target rate of return, $r^{target}$, and do not bid if it is smaller.''  The maximum bid  is the bid that makes the two sides equal. 

% {\color{red}
% \begin{eqnarray}
% r^{target}&=& \delta\left( (1+L(p)) - (1+r)m \right) P^{max}_{bid} + \mathcal{R}_N  \nonumber\\
%    P^{max}_{bid} &=&\frac{r^{target}-\mathcal{R}_N}{\delta\left( (1+L(p)) - (1+r)m \right)} \label{EqBidPrice} 
% \end{eqnarray}}
% %(What makes. this work is that I do not use an identity to get $\dot P$, which made the system of equations singular.)

\section{The period and time value of money}
In developing the model we introduced a number of rates, such as $r_i$, the rate that individual $i$ pays for a single borrowing period. The payment calculation is made for a period of length $T$, which we refer to as a mortgage term.
%This means the actual interest paid is a compounded interest rates (VARIABLES LIST FOR THIS).

%In developing the theoretical model we introduced a number of rates, such as $r_i$, the rate that  individual $i$ pays for a single period of borrowing. We assume the calculations are for a  period of length  $T$, which we refer to as a mortgage term. This means that the rates in equations such XXXXX are actually compounded rates.
Taking a simplified example, if the rate is $x$/year  and  the total mortgage amount borrowed, $M$, interest payments are $xM$  for each of $T$ years. 
If the interest payments are all made at the end of the mortgage term, the lender will require interest on the deferred interest, so agent $i$'s payment at the end of the period $T$ will be:

\begin{align*}
\text{Payment} &= (1+r_i)M                                 \\ 
    &= M + xM(1+x)^{T-1}+ xM(1+x)^{T-2}\dots + xM(1+x)^{0} \\
    &= M\left(1+ x\sum_{z=T-1}^0(1+x)^{z}\right).          \\ 
\end{align*}
Therefore, the interest payment is:
\begin{align*}
r_i.   &=x\sum_{z=T-1}^0(1+x)^{z}.
\end{align*}

For the sake of notational simplicity and clarity of exposition,  we omit the compounding formula throughout our discussion. This means that, while banks may quote a per period interest rates, the equations use a compounded rate. In the computational model we employ the appropriately compounded values. All %the rates are compounded in this way to provide a per-period rates, including all 
 the interest rates, the $r$'s, are compounded in this way, because they require annual or monthly payments at their stated rates.
 It does not affect the discount rates, the $\delta$'s, or the borrowing ratio $m_i$, because they are initially calculated for the term and don't require the same period payments.
 The discount factor $\delta_T$ is always a compounded version of $x$:
 \[\delta_T=\left(\frac{1}{1+\delta}\right)^T\].
%is a feature of the individual, so it is not affected in this way.
%The appropriate compunding expressions for other rates are displayed below.

 The {mortgage term}, $T$, is the period after which the mortgage must be repaid with interest. We work with a mortgage terms for two reasons. First, in the theoretical analysis, by transforming the multi-period transaction to a single period, we simplify the comprehensibility of the analysis. Second, it reflects the fact that in practice agents  likely consider the profitability of a purchase for a finite term longer than one period. The term period lets them consider the time cost of money in their analysis in a natural way. Parameters for their discounting rates and the term considered can be used to explore the effect of borrowing costs and their personal discounting rates on their decisions. Future interest rates are also not fully known. In the future, we can also vary the compound interest rates to explore the impact of uncertainty, given agents' guesses about the future, and their level of risk aversion.

 
\subsection{Incorporating price growth}
%We need a time period T for calculations. For use in any calculation, 

With a price-growth rate of $\dot P$ per year, the growth over $T$ years is $(1+\dot P)^T$, and  %and a 5 year mortgage period, 
the expected price at the end of the period is:

\[P_M^{Te}=P_0(1+\dot P)^T\]

If, for example price growth is 10\%, $\dot P= 0.1$, the {capital gain}, or growth, over a 5-year mortgage term is 0.61051 $\approx$ 60\% of the original price, $P_0$.

% %Individuals and institutions play a role in the housing market through credit markets and direct investment.Agent's access credit shapes worker's ability to purchase homes. Credit is offered by institutions.
% % Agents may be able to foresee future growth. %They may even over invest if they follow market trends and bubbles form. 
% % They can claim a share of the urban wealth as it grows over time by owning the land. 

% %If the return on housing investments is competitive with alternative investments, capital from institutions and individuals will flow into housing. Institutional investors can purchase housing.  Individual households can also allocate a larger share to housing to capture the returns.
% % If the return on investment in housing is competitive with alternative investments, can purchase housing for it's financial return. They can rent housing and sell the asset with appreciation later. We examine the conditions in which this increased demand can drive up prices in the market.

% % Test how linear is this relationship? 

% % \subsubsection{Size of mortgage available, $m_i$}
% % \[m_i= \frac{0.25Y_i}{r_i}\]
% % where $r_i$ is $i$'s cost of capital, $Y_i$ is $i$'s income.

% % \subsubsection{Cost of capital $r_i$}
% % The cost of capital is known to differ for rich and poor. Say for example, the cost of borrowing, $r_i$ for agent $i$ if the base lending rate is $\bar{r}$
% %  \[ r_i = (A + B \frac{\bar{W}}{W_i})\bar r\]
% % where $\bar{W}$ is mean wealth and $W_i$ is individual wealth. %Figure~\ref{Fig:BorrowingCost} illustrates the effect.

% % % \label{Fig:BorrowingCost2}
% % % \end{center}
% % % \end{figure}%

% % This has a number of immediate implications. First, if agents discount at their borrowing rate, wealthier agents a lower discount rate and therefore value properties more highly. 

% % Second, given the  common rule that mortgage payments cannot exceed some fraction of disposable income, the wealthy will be able borrow larger amounts and at lower interest rates that the less wealthy. At any distance from the centre they will be able to make a higher bid.
 
% % If the expected return on a property is greater than the individual cost of borrowing, it would pay any agent to borrow as much as possible and purchase properties as they become available.

% \subsubsection{The rate of return on a property purchase $v$}
% To explore the implication of the financialization of the urban land market we need a function to calculate the return on a unit of land that reflects the actual gradient of opportunity in financial markets. We begin with the price appreciation, $\Delta P=P_T-P_0 = (1+\dot p)P_0-P_0 $, where $\dot p$ is the rate of price appreciation over the period $T$. Rates will all be specified for the period $T$. Transaction costs, including real estate fees, take a fraction from the value of the final sale.

%  The speculator invests a down payment, $D$, and gets back at time $T$ the  increased price $(1+\dot p)P_0$, plus rents, minus any costs and minus the mortgage with interest.
% %footnote{We can include a use value, $U$ in place of rent for expatriate owners to represent using the property - say one month a year - when they are not renting the property and a \textbf{vacancy tax},
% %$T$ at rate $t$ to affect the speculator's  decision.
 
% The rate of return is the value of the gain, $V$,  over the size of the downpayment, $D$, where
% \begin{equation}https://quoteinvestigator.com/2015/08/30/practice/
% V =capital\ gain - Interest\ due  	+ Rent  - operating\ cost\    
% \end{equation}

% The rate of return is $v = \frac{V}{D}$. 

% Both the  share of the price  that can be mortgaged, $m$, and the interest rate  and $r$ may be functions of the agent's wealth. $\delta$ represents the net capital gains tax. It makes it possible to capture the capital gains kept. If it is set to one, it simplifies the equations, all is kept. Keeping the variable offers a policy variable to control the return on financial capital.

% \begin{eqnarray*}
% V  %	&=& capital\ gain - Interest\ due  	+ Rent  - operating\ cost\\
% % 	&=& \delta P_T-D \qquad \qquad \quad - (1+\delta r)M \quad	 + R  	-C\\
% % 	&=& \delta P _T \qquad-(P_0-M) \quad- (1+\delta r)M 	 + R  	-C\\
% %	&=& \delta (1+\dot p)  P_0 -(P_O -M)  -(1+\delta r)mP_0  + R  -C\\
% %	&=& \delta (1+\dot p)  P_0 -P_O + M \qquad -(1+\delta r)mP_0  + R -C\\
% %	&=&( \delta (1+\dot p)-1)  P_0  + mP_0 \quad -(1+ \delta r)mP_0  + (\rho-\kappa)P_0\\	
% %	&=& \left(  \delta (1+\dot p)-1    + m \quad - m(1+\delta r)  + (\rho-\kappa)\right)P_0\\'
% %	&=& \left(  \delta (1+\dot p)-1    + m \quad - m-\delta rm  + (\rho-\kappa)\right)P_0\\
% &=& \delta(P_T- (1+r)M) \qquad \qquad 	 + R  	-C   - T\\
% &=& \delta((1+\dot p)  P_0- (1+r)mP_0)   + \rho P_0  	-\kappa P_0 - tP_0\\
% &=&( \delta((1+\dot p)  - (1+r)m) \ + \rho   	-\kappa -t) P_0
% \end{eqnarray*}

% This is the  net present value of buying, and selling after one period. \textbf{It has  6 exogenous parameters}. Operating revenue and costs $ \rho -\kappa - t$ a present value. 

% The rate of return is $v = \frac{V}{D}$. For expat investors, we get a \textbf{decision rule}:\begin{enumerate}
% \item  if $v \geq a$ (with some private use?) with no rent,  don't bother renting. 
% \item If $v(no\ rent\ and\ tax) < a\leq v(with\ rent)$,  then  rent. 
% \item If $ v(with\ rent) \le a $,  then sell 
% \end{enumerate}

% We can, with some simplifications, write
% \begin{eqnarray}
% \frac{V}{D}&=&( \delta((1+\dot p)  - (1+r)m) \ + \rho   	-\kappa - t ) \frac{P_0}{D}   \nonumber\\
% 		&=&( \delta((1+\dot p)  - (1+r)m) \ + \rho   	-\kappa - t ) \frac{P_0}{P_0-mP_0}   \nonumber\\
% 		&=&\frac{ \delta(1+\dot p  - (1+r)m) \ + \rho   	-\kappa - t } {1-m} \label{Eqn:DecisionRule}
% \end{eqnarray}
