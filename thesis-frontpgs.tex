If is an organizing logic for my work, it may be the tagline for the Systems Design Engineering department: `systems is how we understand the world and design is how we change it.' I feel enormous gratitude to Waterloo for the chance it has offered to engaged with both how to understand systems and how to transform them.  My first job was at Blackberry, in the building with  Mike Lazaridis and the early engineering team. In early engineering projects, I got to work on clocks for the Long Now Foundation, sculptures with Philip Beesley and Rob Gorbet, underwater robots, light based communication protocols, and reverse engineering the Canada arm.

Then I had the good fortune of getting to join Frances Westley's team working on Social Innovation and participating in development of The Waterloo Institute for Complex Systems (WICI). WICI gathered people like Lee Smolin, Brian Arthur, Roberto Unger, Doyne Farmer, Jaron Lanier and so many others to work on how our understanding of complex systems translates to the beneficial transformation of social and ecological systems. 

The dissertation began before we had our two children, and we've entered a much more interdependent world. In a way feel like everyone in my family has done it single handedly: my husband Jason by insisting I go away over March break while he had the stomach flu, was working full-time, and watching our two little kids; my sister who let me stay at her house and helped edit; my parents who insisted I come for weeks to finish draft, fed me and took me snowshoeing every day; and especially my father who talked worked through so much of the economic theory with me. I told my daughter, Jackie, now 6, that I had to go to work on my thesis. She patted me and said `at least you have your sister and your dad to help you.' She is right. 

I am grateful I've had the chance to work with this committee. I'm grateful to Frances and Terry for staying a part of this work as it's evolved, Chrystopher for the inspiration and careful editing; Sean for all our collaborations over the years, and Jangho. I never expected to find a supervisor whose work connected with so many of the pieces of this work, let alone to find one in the Engineering Faculty at Waterloo. It has been wonderful to get the chance to work with all of you. Although there have been challenges, it is hard to imagine a more engaging or stimulating project to get to work on.
