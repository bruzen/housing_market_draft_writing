There are two great % #E MAYBE CHOOSE A MORE PRECISE WORD SUCH AS influential OR dominant
stories of distribution in economics. The first and oldest is based on the classical concept of rent developed by Ricardo, in which owners of an asset are able to extract a value beyond what they contribute. 
% #E ADD HERE: The second is the marginalist approach, developed by Clark and others, in which workers receive the marginal value of their contribution to production. Both of these accounts, frameworks, approaches were developed to explain how wealth is distributed across classes OR populations and both developed in response to the specific social and economic trends of the periods in which they emerged. 
% #E Distribution (ADD DISTRIBUTION TO GLOSSARY) , or how money OR resources OR wealth is allocated across class populations is an important idea in economic. Stories of distribution explain where wealth moves within  society and who captures the surplus, that is the excess wealth over and above WHAT.  %These accounts are, at their heart, stories of who claims what share of production. 
% #E FIRSTNAME Ricardo was a INSERT NATIONALITY classical economist  in the WHICH Century. Classical economics emerged in the 1600 and 1700 at a time of exploding colonial wealth and inequality. In this period, the COUNTRY economy was OR European economies were still structured largely around agricultural feudalism in which farmers OR peasants work the land that is owned by feudal aristocrats, but urban economies based around factories (AND ANYTHING ELSE)and colonial WHAT and trade routes...were just beginning to emerge as significant drivers of wealth. % #E Within this economic context, the surplus is captured by feudal aristocrats % through feudal mechanism of land ownership and flows into emerging town and city economies.

% The Classical Economics of this period was largely descriptive. 

As WHAT LED TO THE EXPLOSION... CHANGES IN UNIVERSITIES OR THE ECONOMY, there was an explosion of thinking about social and economic structures and systems.  This was a period where a range of thinkers explored many ideas to explain the shifting social and economic conditions. 

Distribution, or who got what share of production was a central concern. This focus came to the forefront in the 16 and 1700s as colonial expansion of land holdings, factories and supplied change concentrated wealth- funding investment in the arts and sciences, great fortunes - harsher conditions for farmers, pushed of their land with encloshered, and concentrated in urban factories, almost exclusively poor with - illness bad working conditions % 90 rural,-- population snap shot % (unprecedented in northern Europe, a relative backwater) --  %gt (new ineuqlity- jusxtabosition- fortuioned unpreciendet ont hat content to rivla hsotori great- wons- woth workers dying, kids in factories- Dickens period, pesantry.. - both were new- the eilsure- )
 and concerned with inequality, which suited a time in which the labourers both on the land, and in the emerging factories struggled with poverty, at a time of rapidly growing -
-the intense interest spiked as wealth grew in colonial Europe. %(reformation another answer to this)
NOTABLY THIS WAS AN URBAN TRANSITION- FARMS TO SUBURBS- POWER GROWTH, AN INFLECTION - LIKE COVID REVEALED THE NEW FORM WITH A RAPID MOBILITY CHANGE..
The new form is the urban
dense exchange - experience in person density can compete with screen experience -

In this context, Ricardo developed the classical concept of rent.  % #E Today the word rent is usually used to refer to payments made by a tenant to a landlord to for the right to occupy a property, but this is not the traditional economic concept of  rent.  
% #E As a concept, it's more closely related to profit / surplus than to rent paid for properties. RICARDO SAID... I ALWAYS MEAN...
% #E NEED TO ADD HOW DOES THIS CONTRIBUTE OR EQUATE TO A THEORY OF DISTRIBUTION... WHAT DOES IT EXPLAIN...
Ricardoès concept of rent accounted for the way that.... WHAT IT DESCRIBED. 
This remains important to understanding distribution in general because.....

The second influential story of distribution is the marginalist approach, developed by Clark and others in the WHICH century. This account describes a distribution structure in which workers receive the marginal value of their contribution to production. THIS MEANS...

#E In this period.... WHAT WAS HAPPENING SOMETHING RELATED TO.. %like innovation and the creation of new value in products, with economies of scale, the dominant economic force was the potential for factory production to make things cheap

The marginalist account describes how workers receive the marginal value of their contribution to production. THIS MEANS.....
It formalizes what classical economist Adam Smith describes in the story of the pin factory. (EXPLAIN PIN FACTORY)

The marginalist account of distribution gave a story of production that seemed to align with the rising fortunes of workers following WWII, in the 1950s and 1960s when it came to dominate. 
% This narrative dominates in neo-classical economics, particularly in the United States, and formed the basis of conventional micro-economics training. (EVEN NOW OR WHEN)
% It was also influential in shaping public discourse and policy in the early 20th century. For example, because it implies WHAT THAT MEANS MONOPOLY IS BAD... it provided the intellectual foundation for anti-monopoly political movements in the early 20th century.

These two stories each reflect a distinct dominant mode of production, period in society, and methodological set of tools available.From the Classical to Neo-Classical economic approaches, we also see development in the methodological approaches to describing economies. In Ricardo's era, economics was characterized by a free flowing descriptive approach characterized by wide debate, and many concepts explored. By the the time the marginalist approach emerged, new mathematical approaches were beginning to emerge OR dominate the economic discourse. 

This thesis contributes to a third theory of modern urban rent which integrates the classical descriptive work on rent and the neoclassical marginalist approach, with modern work on the scaling of wealth in cities. 


 NEED TO WRITE SUMMARY OF THIS CURRENT MOVEMENT HERE, INCLUDING
:

Just as the classical and neo-classical approaches responded to and theorized the dominant mode of production in their time, the theoretical framework emerging now, respond to the economic and social factors that are defining this period.  The early stories of production from thinkers like Ricardo centred on exploring who claimed the surplus from agricultural production Over time, the story moved to industrial production. Now the center of production is increasingly NOT URBAN BUT WHAT KIND OF WORK. Industrialization shifted the centres of wealth to cities and this continues to be true.  The social wealth of cities/human capacities developed in cities is central in new world where the production of value by people in cities DOES WHAT.
This is why is useful to draw in urban theory and spatial model (OR WHAT). A theory of production that doesn't center/involve the relation between cities and production/urban space and human capacity simply can't explain the creation of value in the modern world. It will miss WHAT SPECIFICALLY 






They reflect

then marginalist  'gave a story of production that seemed to align with the rising fortunes of workers following WWII, in the 1950s and 1960s when it came to dominate. - peoples fortunes were increasing, the new emerging production seemed central.
now inequality has risen sharply, it seems there is a need for a model that explains what has changed.

This approach also draws on the advancing methodological tools available. The early classical work could reflect rich dynamic stories with many dimensions, by developing theories that responded to and referred to many individual stories. The neo-classical work was able to incorporate increasingly mathematical approaches. Since then, computational capacity and approaches have progressed. This work uses ABM... COMPLEX SYSTEMS that enable us to work with large data sets and complex stories.

\section{Position in the literature}

How does this fit in the larger literature

The focus of this thesis is a topic that falls in the overlap  between least three academic  disciplines, Economics, Urban Geography, and Planning. The central and shared concern in this area is with geographic space.

Figure 1: The common concern of three fields
topic 

A simple economic insight -- that locational value gives rise to land rents -- provides an organizing principle for the three disciplines where they overlap. Locational value explains the spatial distribution of human activities and the distribution of locational rents goes some distance to explaining  core social issues like class structure, inequality, political political power and the dynamics of economic development.  To understand current changes in our urban system we will examine the development of the relevant theoretical tools, beginning with classical rent theory.


Rent theory has a long history in economics, going back to thinkers such as Richard Cantillon (1680s-1734), François Quesnay (1694–1774), the marquis de Mirabeau (1715–1789) and Anne-Robert-Jacques Turgot (name physiocrat) and Adam Smith (1723-1790) and received its classic statement in Ricardo (1772-1823). Nearly contemporaneous thinker, Johann Heinrich  von Th\"unen (1783-1850) developed a planning model to guide the location of economic activities for an urban-agricultural society.  A version of that model  was reinvented in urban geography by XXX. Alonzo\footnote{We use a version of the well-established model of Alonso (1964), Muth (1969) and Mills (1967), and formalised by Wheaton (1974),}

We link the Alonzo model with more recent work on growth theory starting with Robert Solo's XXX and with the endogenous growth models of Lucas () and draw on Jane Jacobs's insight that endogenous urban growth  is. now driving economic development. Jacobs's insight is empirically supported by recent work in the complexity literature on urban scaling by XXXX ()

Figure 3: space and value

Land rent was historically the basis of the wealth and political power of  the land-owning class in the era of the classical economists.


We further link the model of urban rents to emerging concerns about the financialization of the housing market. The key insight we offer is that the financialization  of the housing sector is a  form of rent-seeking that must have detrimental effects on urban development and on the well-being of urban residents.
