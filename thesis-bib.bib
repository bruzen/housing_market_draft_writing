In the long run, the economy looks like the standard growth model with purely labor-augmenting technical change, and the share of labor in GDP is constant. Along the transition path, however, there is capital-augmenting technical change and factor shares change. A range of policies may have counterintuitive implications due to their effect on the direction of technical change. For example, taxes on capital income reduce the labor share in the short run, but increase it in the medium/long run.},

  abstract = {The remote work revolution raises the possibility that a larger segment of the population will be able to sever the geographic linkage between home and work. What are the taxing rights of states as to nonresident remote workers? May a state impose income taxes on nonresident employees only to the extent they are physically working within the state? Does state taxing power extend to all income derived from in-state firms, including wages paid to those who never set foot in the state? Standard sourcing rules attribute wage income to the employee's physical location. In the presence of remote work, however, rigid adherence to this physical presence rule could intensify the progressivity-limiting dynamics of federalism by reducing the costs to households of exploiting labor income tax differentials across jurisdictions. We document the rise of remote work and the status of state-level income tax progressivity as well as its evolution over time. We consider how alternative legal rules for the sourcing of income can affect telework-induced mobility, but conclude that, regardless of which sourcing regime prevails in coming legal battles, the rise of remote work is likely to limit redistribution via state income taxes. While some sourcing rules may better preserve progressivity in the short term than others, the more fundamental threat to progressive state tax regimes derives from remote work's long-term erosion of the benefits of urban spatial clustering. To the extent that the nation's productive cities lose their allure as centers of agglomeration and the wages of high-skilled workers in these cities fall, the ability of their host states to pursue redistributive tax policies will likely be constrained. These deglomeration effects will arise regardless of how state taxing rights are adapted for the remote work era, and therefore may carry with them implications for income tax progressivity at the federal level.},

Yet, men and women behave differently in the labor market. This study sought to uncover whether (i) agglomeration economies in dense areas of Brazil differently benefit men and women; (ii) the female and male UWPs change across the wage distribution, and (iii) whether the male and female UWPs differ across formal and informal jobs. We do so using Brazil's National Continuous Household Sample Survey (PNADC/IBGE) gathered between 2012 and 2019. We found that the female UWP is on average 11.3\%, almost double the average male UWP of 5.7\%. We also found that the female UWP was higher in formal and informal jobs and across various agglomeration levels. Quantile regressions show that the magnitudes of and gender differences in the UWP increase with wages. Studies that exclude women may thus underestimate the UWP, especially for high-paying jobs. The average UWP hides important heterogeneity that exists across the wage distribution and formality status.},

The income tax discriminates against housing conversions with large nonfinancial costs, since these are not deductible. In a perfectly competitive housing market, each housing policy in isolation is distortionary. However, the excess burden of a pair of jointly implemented policies may be less than that for one of the policies in isolation. For some realistic parameter values, a housing allowance aimed at improving the average housing quality consumed by the poor improves efficiency by offsetting part of the deadweight losses of the taxes. The allowance benefits both consumers and landlords in the targeted submarkets, but it hurts landlords on the average by inducing substitution from the non-targeted towards the targeted submarkets.},

Sorting is the main source of the wage premium. Agglomeration economies are in general small, but are larger for workers with skills associated with non-routine job tasks. They also appear to involve human capital accumulation, as evidenced by the change in the wage of workers moving away from denser regions. For workers with routine jobs, agglomeration economies are virtually non-existent. Our results provide further evidence of spatial density bringing about productivity advantages primarily in contexts when problem-solving and interaction with others are important.

In this chapter, we lay out four challenges, past and future, that cities face today and identify policies that can help address the problems we identify. We call attention to the need for many U.S. cities to redevelop the large amount of aging postwar single-family housing, while reforming past exclusionary zoning and infrastructure decisions that exacerbated inequality. Cities will have to fix these past mistakes against the backdrop of an aging population and the rise of remote working, both of which undercut cities' traditional source of growth by reducing the flow of younger and middle-aged people willing to live in urban centers. The common theme running throughout this paper is that cities, their residents and their business leaders will need to embrace a dynamic ethos and be given a freer hand to reposition their municipalities to face a future that is shaping up to be quite different from the past.},

Since ground-rent is a transformation of surplus profit generated in agriculture, the main argument is developed in two steps. In the first step, I derive results on the existence of surplus profit in capitalist agriculture in the absence of landed property. In the second step, I used these results on surplus profit to arrive at the total ground-rent that is appropriated by the owners of land, and also decompose it into the three components that Marx highlighted: absolute rent, differential rent I, and differential rent II. I argue that the power of Marx's analysis lies in the fact that it can be generalised far beyond the domain of agriculture, which he had analysed, and can illuminate the emergence of rent in any system of capitalist commodity production that uses privately owned nonproduced resources that is limited in quantity. Hence, Marx's analysis of ground-rent can be used to investigate many interesting issues in contemporary capitalism.},

The wide breadth of findings is generally not explained by differences in the strength of agglomeration forces across industries, countries or time periods, but by measurement and methodological issues.

Decomposition analyses show that declining R\&D spillovers are responsible for a substantial part of the decline in the rate of TFP growth in Japanese manufacturing. The exit of geographically proximate plants operated by R\&D intensive firms, which may be associated with a relocation of manufacturing activity overseas, plays a notable role in this process and is an important phenomenon in major industrial agglomerations such as Tokyo and Osaka.},

Cities have long been known to be society's predominant engine of innovation and wealth creation, yet they are also its main source of crime, pollution, and disease. The inexorable trend toward urbanization worldwide presents an urgent challenge for developing a predictive, quantitative theory of urban organization and sustainable development. Here we present empirical evidence indicating that the processes relating urbanization to economic development and knowledge creation are very general, being shared by all cities belonging to the same urban system and sustained across different nations and times. Many diverse properties of cities from patent production and personal income to electrical cable length are shown to be power law functions of population size with scaling exponents, beta, that fall into distinct universality classes. Quantities reflecting wealth creation and innovation have beta approximately 1.2 {$>$}1 (increasing returns), whereas those accounting for infrastructure display beta approximately 0.8 {$<$}1 (economies of scale). We predict that the pace of social life in the city increases with population size, in quantitative agreement with data, and we discuss how cities are similar to, and differ from, biological organisms, for which beta{$<$}1. Finally, we explore possible consequences of these scaling relations by deriving growth equations, which quantify the dramatic difference between growth fueled by innovation versus that driven by economies of scale. This difference suggests that, as population grows, major innovation cycles must be generated at a continually accelerating rate to sustain growth and avoid stagnation or collapse.},

A theoretical framework was developed to predict the average social, spatial, and infrastructural properties of cities as a set of scaling relations that apply to all urban systems. Confirmation of these predictions was observed for thousands of cities worldwide, from many urban systems at different levels of development. Measures of urban efficiency, capturing the balance between socioeconomic outputs and infrastructural costs, were shown to be independent of city size and might be a useful means to evaluate urban planning strategies.},

The financial, time, and staff requirements to develop these models has put them beyond the reach of most small to medium sized urban areas. This paper presents the land use allocation submodel of the Simple, Efficient, Elegant, and Effective model of land use and transportation (SE3M), an integrated land use and transportation forecasting model founded upon Economic Base Theory and Bid-rent Theory. The Bid-rent Land Use Model (BLUM) is an agent based, spatial competition model utilizing unique utility curves for willingness to pay and incomes for budget constrained abilities to pay for each agent. The model structure, estimation, calibration, implementation, and validation are presented. With a single year of land use data available, the validation approach used the Kappa Index of Agreement to spatially check model outputs against base year control data while controlling for agreement by chance. The U.S. territory of Guam is used as the case study/proof of concept implementation for this model framework. Once calibrated, BLUM could solve the spatial competition problem on Guam in less than two minutes of processing time with over 90\% accuracy.},

  abstract = {Abstract This paper aims to present and test a methodology capable of determining the impact of urban scenarios and policies through the use of calibrated bid-rents of a spatial interaction model (SIM) as hedonic price estimators of the real estate houses. This approach responds to the increasing requirement of decision support systems to assess complex effects of urban policies because through linking the bid-rents with hedonic prices, it is possible to connect the quantity estimates of the spatial interaction models with the value estimates of the hedonic price approach. The combined methodology is applied to Terceira Island to assess the spatial and economic impact of the decrease in activity of Lajes Military Airfield on employment and on the real estate value of the island. The SIM distributes employment and population by the 31 zones of Terceira Island in the Azores given the distances between zones, the basic employment per zone, the average distances for commuting and shopping and the space available for urban activities. The model's friction parameters are iteratively calibrated to secure that estimated average commuting and shopping distances are equal to those observed in reality; bid-rents are also calibrated to guarantee that the demand for space in each zone does not overcomes the available sspace for urban activities per zone. The SIM is coded and integrated in MATLAB 2013a. Afterward, a hedonic price regression is estimated to explain house prices in relation to the calibrated bid-rents and house typologies. The effect of the Lajes Military Airfield drawdown is estimated by the SIM, which evaluates the impacts on employment and population, and a hedonic price regression is subsequently performed with the new SIM bid-rents,to appraise the new real estate value. Results show that the Lajes Military Airfield reduction of 750 basic employment will result not only in a decrease of 1552 total employments and 3502 of the 56,437 residents of the island but also in a loss of 55 million \texteuro{} in real estate value. The method has proved its usefulness and effectiveness for predicting the impacts of exogenous shocks in complex urban systems.},

In this context, I also analyse the implications of introducing a public education system.}

This article explores and substantiates Harvey's argument by returning to the thesis of capital switching that Harvey, following Henri Lefebvre, initially expounded in the 1970s and 1980s. The nub of this argument was that as capitalist production edges toward periodic crises of overaccumulation, capital "switches" from production per se into production of the urban built environment as a means to absorb surplus capital and hence avert-if only temporarily-crisis. Although Harvey's thesis has proven extremely influential among political economists, urban theorists, and geographers of various stripes, previous attempts to buttress it with empirical evidence have failed to unearth any demonstrable switching dynamic of the kind Harvey theorizes. This article analyzes data for the years leading up to 2007 and the unfolding of the current economic crisis. Focusing primarily on the United Kingdom, it presents two separate analyses that suggest a clear pattern of capital switching into the built environment since the turn of the millennium: first, a switching of overall private-sector expenditures and, second, a switching of pension fund investment. Together, the analyses place urbanization, following Harvey, at the heart of contemporary economic crisis.},

The most important concerns are about endogeneity at the local and individual levels, the choice of a productivity measure between wages and total-factor productivity, and the roles of spatial scale, firms' characteristics, and functional forms. Estimated impacts of local determinants of productivity, employment, and firms' location choices are surveyed for both developed and developing economies.

Yet the addition of the chapter to the third edition of Ricardo's               Principles of Political Economy and Taxation               arguably overturns much of the view for which Ricardo is so well known (Davis 1989). In the added chapter Ricardo allows, contrary to his original view in the first two editions, that the introduction of machinery is indeed injurious to the class of laborers. More interestingly, because machinery substitutes for labor, wages cannot rise and profits are no longer threatened by rising rents. Effectively the contest between capitalists and landlords of the first two editions of the               Principles               is replaced in the final edition by one between capitalists and laborers. However, not only does the ``On Machinery`` chapter substantially change the distributional argument customarily attributed to the               Principles               , but it also permits an examination of Ricardo's thinking about distribution in two distinct, but related frameworks. The discussion here compares the distributional analysis in the first two editions with that of the third to explain the general nature of the Ricardo's theory of profit. It does so by providing a novel interpretation of Ricardo's characterization of profit as a residual, and by emphasizing the historical context in which distribution occurred in the beginning of the nineteenth century.},

The observation at the macroscopic level demonstrates that the aggregated urban quantities (e.g., gross domestic product) scale systematically with population sizes across cities, also known as urban scaling laws. However, at the mesoscopic level, we lack an understanding of whether the simple scaling relationship holds within cities, which is a fundamental question regarding the spatial origin of scaling in urban systems. Here, by analyzing four extensive~datasets covering millions of mobile phone users and urban facilities, we investigate the scaling phenomena within cities. We find that the mesoscopic infrastructure volume and socioeconomic activity scale sub- and super-linearly with the active population, respectively. For a same scaling phenomenon, however, the exponents vary in cities of similar population sizes. To explain these empirical observations, we propose a conceptual framework by considering the heterogeneous distributions of population and facilities, and the spatial interactions between them. Analytical and numerical results suggest that, despite the large number of complexities that influence urban activities, the simple interaction rules can effectively explain the observed regularity and heterogeneity in scaling behaviors within cities.},

Here, we capitalize on \$\textbackslash sim\$ 50 million individuals' smartphone data from 234 Chinese cities to show that urban commuting obeys remarkable regularities. These regularities can be generalized as two laws: (i) the scale-invariance of the average commuting distance across cities, which is a long-awaited validation of Marchetti's constant conjecture, and (ii) a universal inverted U-shape of the commuting distance as a function of the distance from the city centre within cities, indicating that the city centre's attraction is bounded. Motivated by such empirical findings, we develop a simple urban growth model that connects individual-level mobility choices with macroscopic urban spatial structure and faithfully explains both commuting laws. Our results further show that the scale-invariants of human mobility will ultimately lead to the polycentric transition in cities, which could be used to better inform urban development strategies.},

To these questions, the urban growth literature has offered a variety of answers. Within an integrated framework, this chapter reviews key theories with implications for urban growth. It then relates these theories to empirical evidence on the main drivers of city growth, drawn primarily from the United States and other developed countries. Consistent with the monocentric city model, fewer roads and restrictions on housing supply hinder urban growth. The fact that housing is durable also has important effects on the evolution of cities. In recent decades, cities with better amenities have grown faster. Agglomeration economies and human capital are also important drivers of city growth. Although more human capital, smaller firms, and a greater diversity in production foster urban growth, the exact channels through which those effects percolate are not clearly identified. Finally, shocks also determine the fate of cities. Structural changes affecting the broader economy have left a big footprint on the urban landscape. Small city-specific shocks also appear to matter, consistent with the recent wave of random growth models.},

In some instances, there is a wedge between the private costs (or benefits) resulting from some choice made by an economic agent and the social costs (or benefits) accruing to society. Such a wedge occurs when markets fail to mediate properly some economic interactions; that is, when there is an externality. In such a case, the privately optimal decision made by the agent does not lead to a socially optimal outcome. For instance, investors underinvest when they cannot appropriate all the positive returns from their investments. Firms overproduce goods, whose production damages the environment at no cost to them, and so on. Pigou's (1920) ingenious solution to this type of problem is to impose a tax (or a subsidy) so that the private and social costs are made equal. In other words, whenever there is an externality, an appropriately chosen Pigovian tax or subsidy can make agents internalize the external effects of their choices so that the privately optimal decision leads to a socially optimal outcome. After exposing the details of this argument, the Econ101 textbook typically points out that such taxes and subsidies are difficult to implement empirically because of their informational requirements. Then the textbook usually ends the discussion on this topic and turns to something else. From a policy perspective,},

In this setting, the consumption and saving decisions of city residents are determined jointly with their choice of location, thereby offering an initial step to understanding how housing services influence non-durable consumption, and vice versa. Housing, supplied by profit-maximizing land owners, is distinguished from more non-descript varieties of durable consumption by the attributes and amenities it provides occupants. These attributes are limited in supply, indivisible, and distinguished by their location in geographic space and time of development. In equilibrium, both household consumption and the rental price of housing are expressed in terms of the resident household's permanent income. In contrast to models presuming hand-to-mouth dynamics, dwelling rents depend on interest rates, future realizations of economic fundamentals such as income and commuting costs, and accumulated wealth. Finally, residential saving is determined not only by wealth, income, and market prices, but also by city-specific factors such as population, supply constraints, and the opportunity cost of land, suggesting a novel and important role for regional and geographic differences in consumer behavior.},

Empirical evidence shows that distance still matters to both urban and rural land use transition. However, the property-oriented and scale-sensitive functional structure of redevelopment is not exactly what Alonso suggested. The temptation of urbanization, coupled with the resistance of rural revitalization, results in an inverted bid-rent curve in terms of the utilization of rural housing land. The dual-track nature of both urban\textendash rural household registration (hukou) and land use systems contributes a lot for these unconventional findings. We can therefore summarize that transition of land use in both urban and rural China is largely institutionally driven, and the Chinese government is the dominant agent of creating a unique trajectory of spatial restructuring.},

To obtain this result, we collect 3,186 estimates of the elasticity reported in 121 studies, codify 71 variables that reflect the context in which researchers produce their estimates, and address model uncertainty by Bayesian and frequentist model averaging. We employ nonlinear techniques to correct for publication bias, which is responsible for at least half of the overall reduction in the mean elasticity from 0.9 to 0.3. Our findings also suggest that a failure to normalize the production function leads to a substantial upward bias in the estimated elasticity.

Our estimation results imply that the intergenerational wealth elasticity is 3.8 percentage points higher when comparing people with those the same age 6 years previously suggesting strong evidence of higher intergenerational wealth persistence in younger age cohorts.

The paper provides an initial empirical test of the Lerman and Kern modifications, using household level data from Bogota, Colombia. The results of the model are evaluated by comparing forecasted bid-rents to actual rents and forecasted dwelling occupants to actual occupants, by examining the demand prices which emerge from the analysis and by comparing the results to previous housing demand research which uses a hedonic-type approach to analyze identical data. The findings of the study show that the bid-rent model works reasonably well in its predictions and in its estimates of the demand for attributes and, in some ways, it may perform better than a hedonic-type model in forecasting the demand for housing attributes.},

This conceptual framework, referred to as ``the new economic geography,'' aims to identify the determinants of when cities will coalesce and of the size distribution of urban places in a country or region. The conditions identified by the model as being conducive to the formation of cities include declining transportation costs, rising demand for goods produced under increasing returns to scale, and a preference for variety in the commodities and services households buy. The second part of the chapter shows that these conditions came into much greater effect in the United States during the years between 1815 and about 1850 than they had been before. The chapter concludes with a theoretical consideration of where on the map urbanization is likely to take place.},

  abstract = {This article reviews macroeconomic models with heterogeneous households. A key question for the relevance of these models concerns the degree to which markets are complete. This is because the existence of complete markets imposes restrictions on (i) how much heterogeneity matters for aggregate phenomena and (ii) the types of cross-sectional distributions that can be obtained. The degree of market incompleteness, in turn, depends on two factors: (i) the richness of insurance opportunities provided by the economic environment and (ii) the nature and magnitude of idiosyncratic risks to be insured. First, I review a broad collection of empirical evidence\textendash from econometric tests of "full insurance," to quantitative and empirical analyses of the permanent income ("self-insurance") model that examine how it fits the facts about life cycle allocations, to studies that try to directly measure where economies place between these two benchmarks ("partial insurance"). The empirical evidence I survey reveals significant uncertainty in the profession regarding the magnitudes of idiosyncratic risks as well as whether or not these risks have increased since the 1970s. An important difficulty stems from the fact that inequality often arises from a mixture of idiosyncratic risk and fixed (or predictable) heterogeneity, making the two challenging to disentangle. I also discuss applications of incomplete markets models to trends in wealth, consumption, and earnings inequality both over the life cycle and over time, where this challenge is evident. Third, I discuss "approximate" aggregation\textendash the finding that some incomplete markets models generate aggregate implications very similar to representative-agent models. What approximate aggregation does and does not imply is illustrated through several examples. Finally, I discuss some computational issues relevant for solving and calibrating such models and I provide a simple yet fully parallelizable global optimization algorithm that can be used to calibrate heterogeneous agent models.},

  abstract = {This paper employs data from the National Association of Realtors to analyze the time series and cross sectional patterns of bidding wars for houses. The paper generates a number of novel stylized facts. Bidding wars \textendash{} where multiple buyers compete for a house and push its sales price above list price \textendash{} were once rare, a fairly constant 3-4\% of housing sales. This led to treating the list price as a ceiling in empirical and theoretical research on housing transactions. The paper shows that bidding wars have become much more common during the recent housing boom, more than tripling as a share of housing sales between 1995-2005. The share of sales involving bidding wars has fallen during the subsequent bust, but it remains approximately twice as high as it was before the boom. Overall, the paper shows the incidence of bidding wars to be higher in circumstances associated with general macroeconomic and specific housing booms. However, bidding war frequency varies considerably by city, with the share in some cities rising to more than 30\% during the boom and the share in other cities rising hardly at all. This variation, and also the rarity of bidding wars during past booms, suggests that the recent growth of bidding wars is not simply a boom phenomenon. The paper also considers \textendash{} at the MSA and individual housing transaction levels \textendash{} other potential contributing factors, including buyer irrationality, the use of the internet in home purchases, and land use regulation.}

We structurally estimate one of the models in this class and find substantial agglomeration forces in both production and residence.

The share of wealth held by the richest 1\% of households rises by around 0.04, but falls short of the data by more than 10 percentage points.

This allows us to derive empirically based projections for r - g beyond the next five or ten years. Our projections suggest that r - g remains negative for the next two decades in most European countries that we study, but not in the United States. The debt-carrying capacity of governments in Europe is structurally higher now than in recent decades. This allows to worry less about public debt, but does not exempt policy makers from the task to strongly monitor their expenditures and balances, given major challenges ahead.},

This paper describes a bidding model that incorporates these characteristics of housing markets. The new model and the standard model are estimated econometrically and tested against one another using data from the Baltimore, Maryland, area.

Kaplan avoids the bitter disputes among people doing methodology, claiming instead that what is important are those qualities intrinsic to the overall aspirations of the social sciences. He deals with special problems of various disciplines only so far as may be helpful in clarifying the general method of inquiry.The Conduct of Inquiry is a systematic, rounded, and wide-ranging inquiry into behavioral science. Kaplan is guided by the experience of sciences with longer histories, but he is bound neither to their problems nor to their solutions. Instead, he addresses the methodology of behavioral science in the broad sense of both method and science. The work is not a formal exercise in the philosophy of science but rather a critical and constructive assessment of the developing standards and strategies of contemporary social inquiry. He emphasizes the tasks, achievements, limitations, and dilemmas of the newer disciplines.Philosophers of science usually choose to write about the most fully developed sciences because problems are clearer there. The result is ordinarily of little benefit to the behavioral scientist, whose task is clarification of method; here the precedents and analogies of physical science are obscure or inappropriate. The Conduct of Inquiry goes a long way in drawing upon the strengths of social research insights without simplifying the common concerns of the scientific enterprise as a whole. As Leonard Broom noted when the book initially appeared: "Kaplan fills a gap and does so with admirable clarity and often engaging wit. It lacks pomposity, pedantry, and pretension, and it is bound to make an impact on the teaching of and, with luck, research in the behavioral sciences."},

The concept of the Home Market Effect is well known in the literature, but once we extend the number of regions, many are unknown. The main finding of the model suggests that improved market access with respect to an external market enhances the Home Market Effect within the system of the two regions. Interestingly, I show that this finding comes from the fact that improved market access increases the Market Access Effect, while it has no impact on the Market Crowding Effect.},

The recession had profound effects in regional economies, which showed diverse performance based on their capacity to absorb the shock. The concept of economic resilience has been brought to the center of attention with several contributions exploring its determinants. However, the impact of the embeddedness of local economic systems in terms of sales and supplies has been largely unexplored. We use regional input-output tables to approximate the embeddedness of local economies between and, fixed-effects and quantile regressions to test its relationship to regional resistance between 2008 and 2011. We find that during the GR, regional industries opted to change input rather than output markets. Additionally, embeddedness has a curvilinear relationship to regional resistance which varies across the distribution of regional resistance performance. Finally, at the industry level we find regional embeddedness to be important to the resistance of manufacturing and financial and business services and sectoral embeddedness to matter more for the resistance of construction and wholesale, retail \& IT. Our findings highlight nuances that policymakers should be aware of in planning for resilience.},

Under high emissions, CoastalDEM indicates up to 630\,M people live on land below projected annual flood levels for 2100, and up to 340\,M for mid-century, versus roughly 250\,M at present.

  abstract = {The article concentrates on big cities in western societies and the changing principles of urban development since the twentieth century. It combines general principles and the dual cycle theory of urban expansion and urban renewal with the impact of political systems and cultural environments. Three general principles are formative for the internal structure of cities: 1. The accessibility determined by transport technology. 2. The so-called `distance-decay' from center to periphery, defined by the social gradient and the land values gradient. 3. The hierarchical organization of urban space. The dual cycle theory of urban development, explains urban decay as a consequence of the time lag between urban expansion and urban renewal. Development differs greatly depending on whether it takes place under private capitalism, in welfare states, or in postsocialist countries. Three periods of urban development are distinguished. After World War II the system of centered cities dating from the period of Europeanization of the globe, was superseded by city models derived from North America. During the period AD 1950\textendash 2000, a rapidly growing system of suburbia created a sort of extensive \textendash{} though not ubiquitous \textendash{} network. The combination of `urban-like,' suburban structures and new megastructures seems to correspond to postindustrial America's abandonment of the areas of earlier industrial-city development. In the foreseeable future, however, twenty-first century city development is unlikely to follow North American models much longer. All over the globe \textendash{} in the geo-strategically and economically newly relevant BRIC (Brazil, Russia, India, and China) countries as well as in all countries of the Islamic world \textendash{} decision makers have recognized that the inherent functioning of cities (above all of metropolises and capital cities) with the help of state-of-the-art technologies, has gained in importance. Megacities in these regions with populations of 20 million and more surpass all European and North American big cities.},

Using a unique dataset gathering spatially explicit data on rents, population densities, housing sizes, and transport times in neighborhoods inside 192 cities on all continents, we investigate on a systematic basis the empirical relevance of the key stylized facts predicted by this model. Some of these predictions appear extremely robust: cities are more spread out when they are richer, more populated, and when transportation or agricultural land is less costly, and 95\% of the cities of our sample exhibit the predicted negative density gradient from the city center to suburbs. Rent variations inside cities are also significantly explained by transport times in most of the cities (159 cities). However, housing production (and population densities) seem significantly impacted by rents in only slightly more than half of the cities (106 cities). Nevertheless, high levels of informality, strong regulations and planning, specific amenities (e.g. coastal amenities) are, as expected by the theory, main factors leading to the discrepancies. Overall, several decades after its creation, the standard urban model seems to still capture surprisingly well the inner structure of many cities across the world, both in developed and in developing countries.},

Here we show that a microscopic derivation of urban scaling relations for economic quantities vs. population, obtained from the consideration of social and infrastructural properties common to all cities, implies an effective model of economic output in the form of a Cobb-Douglas type production function. As a result we derive a new expression for the Total Factor Productivity (TFP) of urban areas, which is the standard measure of economic productivity per unit of aggregate production factors (labor and capital). Using these results we empirically demonstrate that there is a systematic dependence of urban productivity on city population size, resulting from the mismatch between the size dependence of wages and labor, so that in contemporary US cities productivity increases by about 11\% with each doubling of their population. Moreover, deviations from the average scale dependence of economic output, capturing the effect of local factors, including history and other local contingencies, also manifest surprising regularities. Although, productivity is maximized by the combination of high wages and low labor input, high productivity cities show invariably high wages and high levels of employment relative to their size expectation. Conversely, low productivity cities show both low wages and employment. These results shed new light on the microscopic processes that underlie urban economic productivity, explain the emergence of effective aggregate urban economic output models in terms of labor and capital inputs and may inform the development of economic theory related to growth.},

Here, we develop a large-scale study to test explicitly the relative importance of urban population and Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth in affecting ULE for different regions, economic development levels and governance types for 300+ cities. Our results show that population growth, more than GDP, is consistently the dominant determinant of ULE during 1970\textendash 2014. However, the effect of GDP growth on ULE increases in importance after 2000. In countries with strong governance, economic growth contributes more to ULE than population growth. We find that urban population growth and ULE are correlated but this relationship varies for countries at different developmental stages. Lastly, this study illustrates that good governance is a necessary condition for economic growth to affect ULE.}

Other authors however, place more emphasis on trends in specialisation and differences in productive bases as the driving forces behind urban divergence. Somewhat similarly, Storper (2013) argues that recent divergence been fundamentally been driven by the fact that some cities have become more specialised in knowledge intensive sectors. While most of this interest in urban divergence has been based on US cities, recent European research also reports divergent processes. The aim of this article is to examine the degree of divergence across UK cities and to analyse how far this has been driven by differences among cities in industrial structure and specialisation, tradable bases and productivity.},

We analyze the wage dynamics of migrants from lower to higher density areas in Italy, using quantile regressions and individual data. The results show that unskilled workers benefit more from a wage premium accruing over time, while skilled workers enjoy a wage premium when they migrate as well as a wage increase over time. Further, we find that for unskilled workers the wage growth over time is mainly due to human capital accumulation in line with the ``learning'' hypothesis, while for skilled workers the wage growth is mainly explained by the ``coordination'' hypothesis, i.e., cities enhance the probability of better matches between workers and firms.},

A second objective of this paper is to evaluate the proposition that theirs was indeed the founding act in the field by concentrating on the earliest versions of their work on the model, rather than on the enormous literature that followed.

We use a quasi-experimental design and Swedish administrative data to document that the average heir depletes her inheritance within a decade while the inheritances of wealthy heirs remain intact. These different depletion rates are not due to different consumption or labour supply responses but due to different rates of return on inherited wealth. Upon their receipt, inheritances reduce relative measures of wealth inequality, such as top shares or percentile ratios. Theoretically, this reduction in inequality could be due to either a compressed inheritance distribution or similar chances of having wealthy parents (high intergenerational mobility). Empirically, the first force is more significant in Sweden. Within a decade, however, the effect is reversed: inheritances increase wealth inequality since the different depletion rates widen the inequality in inherited wealth over time. This implies that inheritance taxation can reduce long run wealth inequality only through the taxation of wealthy heirs.},

We introduce a new methodology for discriminating between the three leading explanations for this suburbanization (workplace attractiveness, residence attractiveness and bilateral commuting frictions). This methodology holds in the class of spatial models that are characterized by a structural gravity equation for commuting. We show that the increased openness of counties to commuting is mainly explained by reductions in bilateral commuting frictions, consistent with the expansion of the interstate highway network and the falling real cost of car ownership. We find that changes in workplace attractiveness and residence attractiveness are more important in explaining the observed shift in employment by workplace and employment by residence towards lower densities over time.},

If such a theory is feasible, then its formulation must be in a mathematical way. As a contribution to organizing the mathematical ideas that deal with such a systematic way of understanding urban phenomena, we present this material, concentrating on one important aspect of what recently has been called the new science of cities. In this paper, we review the main mathematical models present in the literature that aim at explaining the origin and emergence of urban scaling. We intend to present the models, identify similarities and connections between them, and find situations in which different models lead to the same output. In addition, we report situations in which some ideas initially introduced in a particular model can also be introduced in another model, generating more diversification and increasing the scope of the models. The models treated in this paper explain urban scaling from different premises: from gravity ideas, passing through densification ideas and cites' geometry, to a hierarchical organization and socio-network properties. We also investigate scenarios in which these different fundamental ideas could be interpreted as similar -- where the similarity is likely but not obvious. Furthermore, in what concerns the gravity idea, we propose a general framework that includes all gravity models analyzed as a particular case.},

This study tests this hypothesis for the case of Colombia. We ask whether knowledge externalities lead to growth in economic complexity. If yes, which variety of knowledge externalities\textemdash Marshall-Arrow-Romer (MAR), Porter or Jacobs? Results from our empirical investigation uphold the MAR theories of externalities or intra-industrial externalities, which are maximized with high local specialization1 and local monopoly. A pattern of convergence in economic complexity of Colombian municipalities emerges from our results, supporting Schumpeterian growth theories, which advocate that knowledge externalities drive convergence. This is in line with the recent macroeconomic trends of the Colombian economy, which is suffering from ``Dutch disease'' leading to a contraction in its domestic economy. We show that knowledge externalities are a mechanism through which convergence dynamics are brought about and fostered in the domestic economy.},

  abstract = {A key driver of urbanization is the pursuit of economic opportunities in cities. One such opportunity is the promise of higher wages in larger cities, a phenomenon known as the urban wage premium. While an urban wage premium has been well-documented among U.S. metropolitan areas, little is known about its existence in micropolitan areas, which represent an important link between rural and dense urban areas. Here we measure the power law scaling coefficient of annual wages versus employment for both U.S. metropolitan and micropolitan areas over a 37-year period. We take this coefficient to be a quantification of the urban wage premium for each type of urban area and find the relationship is superlinear in all years for both area types. Though both area types once had wage premiums of similar magnitude, the wage premium in micropolitan areas has steadily declined since the late 1980s while in metropolitan areas it has generally increased. This growing gap between micropolitan and metropolitan wage premiums is ongoing in parallel to other diverging characteristics, such as inequality and voting behavior, suggesting that our result is part of a broader social, cultural, and political divergence between small and large cities. Finally, we speculate that if urban residents respond to the COVID-19 crisis by migrating, the trends we describe may change significantly.},

Using the concept of stability areas to study the transition from one stable equilibrium to the next, we show that decreasing commuting or transportation costs generate equilibrium paths that may feature a megalopolis or hierarchical system of cities having different sizes. We confirm that transportation and commuting costs have opposite impacts on the space-economy.},

Many of the distinctive theoretical implications of learning by doing have been derived under the assumption that the cost\textendash quantity relationships observed in numerous empirical studies are largely the result of passive learning and some further require that passive learning is unbounded. The empirical literature raises doubts about both assumptions. When observed cost\textendash quantity relationships indicate sustained productivity growth, factors other than passive learning are generally at work. When passive learning is the dominant factor, productivity growth is invariably bounded. Thus, empirically relevant theories incorporating learning by doing are hybrid models in which passive learning coexists with other sources of growth. But in such models, many of the distinctive implications of passive learning become unimportant. Moreover, passive learning is often an inessential component of long-run growth; to the contrary, too much learning can lead to stagnation.},

We also explore the role of inter-city technology diffusion as being behind the surge of local innovation. To do it, we compute least-cost paths between city-pairs, over time, based on the opening and speed of each HSR line, and obtain that an increase in a city's connectivity to other cities specialized in a specific technological field, through the HSR network, increases the probability for the city to specialize in that same technological field.

The diversification thesis argues that knowledge spills over between different industries, causing diversified production structures to be more innovative. A closely related debate evolves around local competitiveness hypotheses. Using an original database of innovation counts, both these issues are addressed for the Dutch context. The results show that the Marshallian specialization thesis holds, though more pronounced for R\&D intensive and small firms.

To overcome this problem, a wide variety of external instruments has been applied in the literature. However, the use of instruments may lead to wrong inference if they are either weak, or endogenous to the system being estimated. In this paper, we extend the widely used Feenstra (1994) estimator, which does not depend on external instruments, to make it applicable to the problem of estimating the elasticity of substitution between capital and labour. We propose a pooled GMM (PGMM) estimator, examine its properties in a Monte Carlo study and apply it to a Norwegian sample of manufacturing firms. We identify the conditions under which P-GMM yields unbiased estimates and compare it to a fixed effects estimator which is unbiased when factor prices are exogenous - a typical assumption in the literature. We find that the fixed effects estimator is heavily downward biased in the presence of simultaneity. In contrast, the P-GMM estimator is nearly unbiased provided the number of time periods (T) is not too small (say, more than 10). In our application, with an unbalanced sample and T = 12, we estimate the elasticity of substitution to be 1.8 using P-GMM and 1.0 using a fixed effects estimator. Hence, neglecting simultaneity may lead to the conclusion that capital and labour are complements when, in fact, they are substitutes.},

The Irish government created the National Assets Administration (NAMA) to purchase bad real estate loans from banks to solve credit problems. In 2013, Ireland introduced the REIT law. The establishment of REIT brought sustainable activities to the real estate market. REIT has attracted many investors and reintroduced working capital to the construction industry. In 2020, COVID-19 began to spread in Ireland. The epidemic greatly limited the development of some real estate and the operation strategy of REIT. This article draws a conclusion through the qualitative analysis of REIT. REIT plays an important role in the recovery of Irish real estate market economy. At the same time, it also has a great impact on Irish real estate market. However, REIT has been established for a long time, so it is impossible to quantify its future performance with existing data.},

We then overview some of the contemporary strands of literature that have developed since the break down of this consensus, namely political economy approaches centred on capital-switching, institutionalism of various stripes, and the rent gap theory. We offer a critical urban political economy perspective and a particular set of arguments run through the review: first, land is not the same as capital but has unique attributes as a factor of production which require a separate theorisation. Second, since the 1970s consensus around land rent and the city dissipated, the critical literature has tended to take the question of why/how the payment exists at all for granted and so has ignored the particular dynamics of rent arising from the idiosyncrasies of land. Amongst the talk of an `Anthropocene' and `planetary urbanisation' it is surprising that the economic fulcrum of the capitalist remaking of geography has fallen so completely off the agenda. It is time to bring rent back into the analysis of land, cities and capitalism.},

  abstract = {Urban scaling laws describe powerful universalities of the scaling relationships between urban attributes and the city size across different countries and times. There are still challenges in precise statistical estimation of the scaling exponent; the properties of variance require further study. In this paper, a statistical regression method based on the maximum likelihood estimation considering the lower bound constraints and the heterogeneous variance of error structure, termed as CHVR, is proposed for urban scaling estimation. In the CHVR method, the heterogeneous properties of variance are explored and modeled in the form of a power-of-the-mean variance model. The maximum likelihood fitting method is supplemented to satisfy the lower bound constraints in empirical data. The CHVR method has been applied to estimating the scaling exponents of six urban attributes covering three scaling regimes in China and compared with two traditional methods. Method evaluations based on three different criteria validate that compared with both classical methods, the CHVR method is more effective and robust. Moreover, a statistical test and long-term variations of the parameter in the variance function demonstrate that the proposed heterogeneous variance function can not only describe the heterogeneity in empirical data adequately but also provide more meaningful urban information. Therefore, the CHVR method shows great potential to provide a valuable tool for effective urban scaling studies across the world and be applied to scaling law estimation in other complex systems in the future.},
