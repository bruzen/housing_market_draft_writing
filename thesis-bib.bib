  abstract = {Cities today are confronting never-before-seen challenges to their top spot in the economic hierarchy. In this chapter, we lay out four challenges, past and future, that cities face today and identify policies that can help address the problems we identify. We call attention to the need for many U.S. cities to redevelop the large amount of aging postwar single-family housing, while reforming past exclusionary zoning and infrastructure decisions that exacerbated inequality. Cities will have to fix these past mistakes against the backdrop of an aging population and the rise of remote working, both of which undercut cities' traditional source of growth by reducing the flow of younger and middle-aged people willing to live in urban centers. The common theme running throughout this paper is that cities, their residents and their business leaders will need to embrace a dynamic ethos and be given a freer hand to reposition their municipalities to face a future that is shaping up to be quite different from the past.},

Estimating geographic decay functions based on the location of the universe of manufacturing plants run by R\&D conducting firms and public research institutions in Japan, we find a positive influence of both private and public technologically proximate-R\&D stocks, which decay in distance and become negligible at around 500 kilometers. Decomposition analyses show that declining R\&D spillovers are responsible for a substantial part of the decline in the rate of TFP growth in Japanese manufacturing. The exit of geographically proximate plants operated by R\&D intensive firms, which may be associated with a relocation of manufacturing activity overseas, plays a notable role in this process and is an important phenomenon in major industrial agglomerations such as Tokyo and Osaka.},

Cities have long been known to be society's predominant engine of innovation and wealth creation, yet they are also its main source of crime, pollution, and disease. The inexorable trend toward urbanization worldwide presents an urgent challenge for developing a predictive, quantitative theory of urban organization and sustainable development. Here we present empirical evidence indicating that the processes relating urbanization to economic development and knowledge creation are very general, being shared by all cities belonging to the same urban system and sustained across different nations and times. Many diverse properties of cities from patent production and personal income to electrical cable length are shown to be power law functions of population size with scaling exponents, beta, that fall into distinct universality classes. Quantities reflecting wealth creation and innovation have beta approximately 1.2 {$>$}1 (increasing returns), whereas those accounting for infrastructure display beta approximately 0.8 {$<$}1 (economies of scale). We predict that the pace of social life in the city increases with population size, in quantitative agreement with data, and we discuss how cities are similar to, and differ from, biological organisms, for which beta{$<$}1. Finally, we explore possible consequences of these scaling relations by deriving growth equations, which quantify the dramatic difference between growth fueled by innovation versus that driven by economies of scale. This difference suggests that, as population grows, major innovation cycles must be generated at a continually accelerating rate to sustain growth and avoid stagnation or collapse.},

In this context, I also analyse the implications of introducing a public education system.}

To these questions, the urban growth literature has offered a variety of answers. Within an integrated framework, this chapter reviews key theories with implications for urban growth. It then relates these theories to empirical evidence on the main drivers of city growth, drawn primarily from the United States and other developed countries. Consistent with the monocentric city model, fewer roads and restrictions on housing supply hinder urban growth. The fact that housing is durable also has important effects on the evolution of cities. In recent decades, cities with better amenities have grown faster. Agglomeration economies and human capital are also important drivers of city growth. Although more human capital, smaller firms, and a greater diversity in production foster urban growth, the exact channels through which those effects percolate are not clearly identified. Finally, shocks also determine the fate of cities. Structural changes affecting the broader economy have left a big footprint on the urban landscape. Small city-specific shocks also appear to matter, consistent with the recent wave of random growth models.},

  abstract = {The case for corrective economic policies as stated in Econ101 is relatively straightforward. In some instances, there is a wedge between the private costs (or benefits) resulting from some choice made by an economic agent and the social costs (or benefits) accruing to society. Such a wedge occurs when markets fail to mediate properly some economic interactions; that is, when there is an externality. In such a case, the privately optimal decision made by the agent does not lead to a socially optimal outcome. For instance, investors underinvest when they cannot appropriate all the positive returns from their investments. Firms overproduce goods, whose production damages the environment at no cost to them, and so on. Pigou's (1920) ingenious solution to this type of problem is to impose a tax (or a subsidy) so that the private and social costs are made equal. In other words, whenever there is an externality, an appropriately chosen Pigovian tax or subsidy can make agents internalize the external effects of their choices so that the privately optimal decision leads to a socially optimal outcome. After exposing the details of this argument, the Econ101 textbook typically points out that such taxes and subsidies are difficult to implement empirically because of their informational requirements. Then the textbook usually ends the discussion on this topic and turns to something else. From a policy perspective,},

In this setting, the consumption and saving decisions of city residents are determined jointly with their choice of location, thereby offering an initial step to understanding how housing services influence non-durable consumption, and vice versa. Housing, supplied by profit-maximizing land owners, is distinguished from more non-descript varieties of durable consumption by the attributes and amenities it provides occupants. These attributes are limited in supply, indivisible, and distinguished by their location in geographic space and time of development. In equilibrium, both household consumption and the rental price of housing are expressed in terms of the resident household's permanent income. In contrast to models presuming hand-to-mouth dynamics, dwelling rents depend on interest rates, future realizations of economic fundamentals such as income and commuting costs, and accumulated wealth. Finally, residential saving is determined not only by wealth, income, and market prices, but also by city-specific factors such as population, supply constraints, and the opportunity cost of land, suggesting a novel and important role for regional and geographic differences in consumer behavior.},

The second part of the chapter shows that these conditions came into much greater effect in the United States during the years between 1815 and about 1850 than they had been before.

The share of wealth held by the richest 1\% of households rises by around 0.04, but falls short of the data by more than 10 percentage points. Discount rate heterogeneity also helps to account for the large wealth inequality observed among households with similar lifetime earnings.},

The main finding of the model suggests that improved market access with respect to an external market enhances the Home Market Effect within the system of the two regions.

We use a quasi-experimental design and Swedish administrative data to document that the average heir depletes her inheritance within a decade while the inheritances of wealthy heirs remain intact. These different depletion rates are not due to different consumption or labour supply responses but due to different rates of return on inherited wealth. Upon their receipt, inheritances reduce relative measures of wealth inequality, such as top shares or percentile ratios. Theoretically, this reduction in inequality could be due to either a compressed inheritance distribution or similar chances of having wealthy parents (high intergenerational mobility). Empirically, the first force is more significant in Sweden. Within a decade, however, the effect is reversed: inheritances increase wealth inequality since the different depletion rates widen the inequality in inherited wealth over time. This implies that inheritance taxation can reduce long run wealth inequality only through the taxation of wealthy heirs.},

The recession had profound effects in regional economies, which showed diverse performance based on their capacity to absorb the shock. The concept of economic resilience has been brought to the center of attention with several contributions exploring its determinants. However, the impact of the embeddedness of local economic systems in terms of sales and supplies has been largely unexplored. We use regional input-output tables to approximate the embeddedness of local economies between and, fixed-effects and quantile regressions to test its relationship to regional resistance between 2008 and 2011. We find that during the GR, regional industries opted to change input rather than output markets. Additionally, embeddedness has a curvilinear relationship to regional resistance which varies across the distribution of regional resistance performance. Finally, at the industry level we find regional embeddedness to be important to the resistance of manufacturing and financial and business services and sectoral embeddedness to matter more for the resistance of construction and wholesale, retail \& IT. Our findings highlight nuances that policymakers should be aware of in planning for resilience.}

  abstract = {The quest for a theory of cities that could offer a quantitative and systematic approach to manage cities is at the top priority, given the challenges humanity faces due to the increasing urbanization and densification of cities. If such a theory is feasible, then its formulation must be in a mathematical way. As a contribution to organizing the mathematical ideas that deal with such a systematic way of understanding urban phenomena, we present this material, concentrating on one important aspect of what recently has been called the new science of cities. In this paper, we review the main mathematical models present in the literature that aim at explaining the origin and emergence of urban scaling. We intend to present the models, identify similarities and connections between them, and find situations in which different models lead to the same output. In addition, we report situations in which some ideas initially introduced in a particular model can also be introduced in another model, generating more diversification and increasing the scope of the models. The models treated in this paper explain urban scaling from different premises: from gravity ideas, passing through densification ideas and cites' geometry, to a hierarchical organization and socio-network properties. We also investigate scenarios in which these different fundamental ideas could be interpreted as similar -- where the similarity is likely but not obvious. Furthermore, in what concerns the gravity idea, we propose a general framework that includes all gravity models analyzed as a particular case.},

The Irish government created the National Assets Administration (NAMA) to purchase bad real estate loans from banks to solve credit problems. In 2013, Ireland introduced the REIT law. The establishment of REIT brought sustainable activities to the real estate market. REIT has attracted many investors and reintroduced working capital to the construction industry. In 2020, COVID-19 began to spread in Ireland. The epidemic greatly limited the development of some real estate and the operation strategy of REIT. This article draws a conclusion through the qualitative analysis of REIT. REIT plays an important role in the recovery of Irish real estate market economy. At the same time, it also has a great impact on Irish real estate market. However, REIT has been established for a long time, so it is impossible to quantify its future performance with existing data.},
