  abstract = {This paper examines the distributional impact of capital account liberalization. Using panel data for 149 countries from 1970 to 2010, we find that, on average, capital account liberalization reforms increase inequality and reduce the labor share of income in the short and medium term. We also find that the level of financial development and the occurrence of crises play a key role in shaping the response of inequality to capital account liberalization reforms.},

  abstract = {Based on the standard Footloose Capital model developed by Martin and Rogers (1995), I consider an integrated model that consists of a system of two regions and a third external region, in order to study the impact of improved market access on the Home Market Effect within the system of the two regions. The concept of the Home Market Effect is well known in the literature, but once we extend the number of regions, many are unknown. The main finding of the model suggests that improved market access with respect to an external market enhances the Home Market Effect within the system of the two regions. Interestingly, I show that this finding comes from the fact that improved market access increases the Market Access Effect, while it has no impact on the Market Crowding Effect.},

  abstract = {In 2008, Ireland's real estate bubble economy burst, which ushered in a real estate market crash and credit crisis in Ireland. The Irish government created the National Assets Administration (NAMA) to purchase bad real estate loans from banks to solve credit problems. In 2013, Ireland introduced the REIT law. The establishment of REIT brought sustainable activities to the real estate market. REIT has attracted many investors and reintroduced working capital to the construction industry. In 2020, COVID-19 began to spread in Ireland. The epidemic greatly limited the development of some real estate and the operation strategy of REIT. This article draws a conclusion through the qualitative analysis of REIT. REIT plays an important role in the recovery of Irish real estate market economy. At the same time, it also has a great impact on Irish real estate market. However, REIT has been established for a long time, so it is impossible to quantify its future performance with existing data.},
