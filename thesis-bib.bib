A number of lessons can be drawn regarding the temporality and spatiality of financializing `the urban'. Firstly, the financial crisis that started in 2007 has not resulted in a definancialization of the city. Secondly, despite a number of common trends, the literature also highlights the diversity of experiences. Yet it would be too easy to conclude that the financialization of the land, housing and real estate is exclusively a Global North phenomenon, as it extends into the Global South. Finally, the literature notes an emerging gentrification-touristification-financialization nexus. The role of the state in all of this is variegated and often ambiguous.},

Despite the varied analyses of the financialization of housing and the importance of housing to financialization, the relations between housing and financialization remain under-researched and under-theorized. The financialization of housing is not really a specific form of financialization, transcending as it does a number of different forms of financialization. Housing systems, in particular, vary widely across the globe, which implies that housing financialization will be inherently variegated, path-dependent and uneven. In this introduction to the symposium, I will discuss how the articles to follow contribute to the literature on the financialization of housing. Housing has entered a post-Fordist, neoliberal and financialized regime. Increasingly, both mortgaged homeownership and subsidized rental housing are there to keep financial markets going, rather than being facilitated by those markets. There is little evidence that the global financial crisis has resulted in any de-financialization of housing. There are common trajectories within uneven and variegated financialization, rather than radically different and completely unrelated forms of housing financialization.},

Traditionally, this phenomenon has been explained by differences among cities in either the degree of internal scale economies or the elasticity of external economies. This paper relates size differences between cities to differences in the dominant agglomeration force between cities. We analyze this relationship via an equilibrium model of two cities that are embedded in a national economy. One of the cities produces two traded goods with urbanization economies being the dominant agglomeration force. The other city produces only one traded good with localization economies being the dominant force. Our first main result is that the two-product city can be larger than the one-product city in stable equilibrium, if at least one of the two industries exhibits decreasing returns in production. Otherwise, the one-product city is larger. Second, we obtain an existence result for the equilibrium of both cities. We also analyze the relationship between optimum sizes of the two cities using an optimum city size model for each city. Finally, we compare the equilibrium and optimum city sizes. By doing so we identify the condition under which the stable equilibrium city size is smaller than the optimum city size.},

  abstract = {The remote work revolution raises the possibility that a larger segment of the population will be able to sever the geographic linkage between home and work. What are the taxing rights of states as to nonresident remote workers? May a state impose income taxes on nonresident employees only to the extent they are physically working within the state? Does state taxing power extend to all income derived from in-state firms, including wages paid to those who never set foot in the state? Standard sourcing rules attribute wage income to the employee's physical location. In the presence of remote work, however, rigid adherence to this physical presence rule could intensify the progressivity-limiting dynamics of federalism by reducing the costs to households of exploiting labor income tax differentials across jurisdictions. We document the rise of remote work and the status of state-level income tax progressivity as well as its evolution over time. We consider how alternative legal rules for the sourcing of income can affect telework-induced mobility, but conclude that, regardless of which sourcing regime prevails in coming legal battles, the rise of remote work is likely to limit redistribution via state income taxes. While some sourcing rules may better preserve progressivity in the short term than others, the more fundamental threat to progressive state tax regimes derives from remote work's long-term erosion of the benefits of urban spatial clustering. To the extent that the nation's productive cities lose their allure as centers of agglomeration and the wages of high-skilled workers in these cities fall, the ability of their host states to pursue redistributive tax policies will likely be constrained. These deglomeration effects will arise regardless of how state taxing rights are adapted for the remote work era, and therefore may carry with them implications for income tax progressivity at the federal level.},

To structurally estimate agglomeration and dispersion forces, we use data on thousands of city blocks in Berlin for 1936, 1986, and 2006 and exogenous variation from the city's division and reunification. We estimate substantial and highly localized production and residential externalities. We show that the model with the estimated agglomeration parameters can account both qualitatively and quantitatively for the observed changes in city structure. We show how our quantitative framework can be used to undertake counterfactuals for changes in the organization of economic activity within cities in response, for example, to changes in the transport network.},

The comparability of results in a multicountry setting is supported through the use of a new internationally harmonised definition of cities based on economic linkages rather than administrative boundaries. The analysis finds that cities with fragmented governance structures tend to have lower levels of productivity. The estimated elasticity for an increase in the number of local jurisdiction is 0.06, which is halved by the existence of a metropolitan governance body. The productivity effect is sizeable and at least as important as the agglomeration benefit found due to city size.},

We do so using Brazil's National Continuous Household Sample Survey (PNADC/IBGE) gathered between 2012 and 2019. We found that the female UWP is on average 11.3\%, almost double the average male UWP of 5.7\%. We also found that the female UWP was higher in formal and informal jobs and across various agglomeration levels. Quantile regressions show that the magnitudes of and gender differences in the UWP increase with wages. Studies that exclude women may thus underestimate the UWP, especially for high-paying jobs. The average UWP hides important heterogeneity that exists across the wage distribution and formality status.},

The income tax discriminates against housing conversions with large nonfinancial costs, since these are not deductible. In a perfectly competitive housing market, each housing policy in isolation is distortionary. However, the excess burden of a pair of jointly implemented policies may be less than that for one of the policies in isolation. For some realistic parameter values, a housing allowance aimed at improving the average housing quality consumed by the poor improves efficiency by offsetting part of the deadweight losses of the taxes. The allowance benefits both consumers and landlords in the targeted submarkets, but it hurts landlords on the average by inducing substitution from the non-targeted towards the targeted submarkets.},

  abstract = {Abstract We estimate the respective importance of spatial sorting and agglomeration economies in explaining the urban wage premium for workers with different sets of skills. Sorting is the main source of the wage premium. Agglomeration economies are in general small, but are larger for workers with skills associated with non-routine job tasks. They also appear to involve human capital accumulation, as evidenced by the change in the wage of workers moving away from denser regions. For workers with routine jobs, agglomeration economies are virtually non-existent. Our results provide further evidence of spatial density bringing about productivity advantages primarily in contexts when problem-solving and interaction with others are important. Resumen En este art{\'i}culo estimamos la importancia respectiva de las econom{\'i}as de clasificaci{\'o}n y de aglomeraci{\'o}n espacial en cuanto a explicar la prima salarial de los trabajadores urbanos con diferentes conjuntos de habilidades. La clasificaci{\'o}n es la fuente principal de la prima salarial. Las econom{\'i}as de aglomeraci{\'o}n son peque{\~n}as en general, pero son mayores para los trabajadores competentes en tareas laborales no rutinarias.

Using micro-econometric decomposition techniques, this paper shows that part of this increase can be explained by changes in the characteristics of households, including age, household structure, income and education. Nevertheless, a significant portion of the change in homeownership rates remains unexplained by shifts in household characteristics, leaving a potential role for public policy in explaining developments in homeownership rates. Panel estimates suggest that the relaxation of down-payment constraints on mortgage loans has increased homeownership rates among credit-constrained households over recent decades, resulting in a rise in the aggregate homeownership rate that is comparable with the impact of population ageing. In countries where tax relief on mortgage debt financing is generous, however, the expansionary impact of mortgage market innovations on homeownership is smaller. This is consistent with the tendency for such housing tax relief to be capitalised into real house prices, which may crowd-out some financially constrained households from homeownership at the margin. The impact of housing policies regulating the functioning of the rental market, such as rent regulation and provisions for tenure security, on tenure choice is also explored.},

Human networking and productivity exhibit heavy-tailed distributions, with some individuals contributing disproportionately to city totals. Here we use micro-level data from Europe and the United States on interconnectivity, productivity and innovation in cities. We find that the tails of within-city distributions and their growth by city size account for 36--80\% of previously reported scaling effects, and 56--87\% of the variance in scaling between indicators of varying economic complexity. Providing explanatory depth to these findings, we identify a mechanism---city size-dependent cumulative advantage---that constitutes an important channel through which differences in the size of tails emerge. Our findings demonstrate that urban scaling is in large part a story about inequality in cities, implying that the causal processes underlying the heavier tails in larger cities must be considered in explanations of urban scaling. This result also shows that agglomeration effects benefit urban elites the most, with the majority of city dwellers partially excluded from the socio-economic benefits of growing cities.},

In this chapter, we lay out four challenges, past and future, that cities face today and identify policies that can help address the problems we identify. We call attention to the need for many U.S. cities to redevelop the large amount of aging postwar single-family housing, while reforming past exclusionary zoning and infrastructure decisions that exacerbated inequality. Cities will have to fix these past mistakes against the backdrop of an aging population and the rise of remote working, both of which undercut cities' traditional source of growth by reducing the flow of younger and middle-aged people willing to live in urban centers. The common theme running throughout this paper is that cities, their residents and their business leaders will need to embrace a dynamic ethos and be given a freer hand to reposition their municipalities to face a future that is shaping up to be quite different from the past.},

Since ground-rent is a transformation of surplus profit generated in agriculture, the main argument is developed in two steps. In the first step, I derive results on the existence of surplus profit in capitalist agriculture in the absence of landed property. In the second step, I used these results on surplus profit to arrive at the total ground-rent that is appropriated by the owners of land, and also decompose it into the three components that Marx highlighted: absolute rent, differential rent I, and differential rent II. I argue that the power of Marx's analysis lies in the fact that it can be generalised far beyond the domain of agriculture, which he had analysed, and can illuminate the emergence of rent in any system of capitalist commodity production that uses privately owned nonproduced resources that is limited in quantity. Hence, Marx's analysis of ground-rent can be used to investigate many interesting issues in contemporary capitalism.},

This paper surveys these scholarly contributions and summarizes their results according to their similarities and differences. The reviewed empirical work presents a diverse picture of possible conditions and circumstances under which each kind of externalities could be at work. The wide breadth of findings is generally not explained by differences in the strength of agglomeration forces across industries, countries or time periods, but by measurement and methodological issues. The levels of industrial and geographical aggregation together with the choice of performance measures, specialization and diversity indicators are the main causes for the lack of resolution in the debate. The 3-digit industrial classification seems to be the level at which MAR and Jacobs effects are undistinguishable from one another, and this is often exacerbated by a high level of geographical aggregation.},

Using pooled Census of Population data for 242 urban centres, we evaluate the link between long-run employment growth and the supply of different types of skilled labour. The paper also examines whether the scientific capabilities of cities are influenced by amenities such as the size of the local cultural sector. The first part of the paper investigates the contribution of broad and specialized forms of human capital to long-run employment growth. We differentiate between employed degree holders (a general measure of human capital) and degree holders employed in science and cultural occupations (specific measures of human capital). Our growth models investigate long-run changes in urban employment from 1980 to 2000, and control for other factors that have been posited to influence the growth of cities. These include measures of amenities that capture differences in the attractiveness of urban areas. The second part of the paper focuses specifically on a particular type of human capital---degree holders in science and engineering occupations. Our models evaluate the factors associated with the medium- and long-run growth of these occupations. Particular attention is placed on disentangling the relationships between science and engineering growth and other forms of human capital.},

Decomposition analyses show that declining R\&D spillovers are responsible for a substantial part of the decline in the rate of TFP growth in Japanese manufacturing. The exit of geographically proximate plants operated by R\&D intensive firms, which may be associated with a relocation of manufacturing activity overseas, plays a notable role in this process and is an important phenomenon in major industrial agglomerations such as Tokyo and Osaka.},

Cities have long been known to be society's predominant engine of innovation and wealth creation, yet they are also its main source of crime, pollution, and disease. The inexorable trend toward urbanization worldwide presents an urgent challenge for developing a predictive, quantitative theory of urban organization and sustainable development. Here we present empirical evidence indicating that the processes relating urbanization to economic development and knowledge creation are very general, being shared by all cities belonging to the same urban system and sustained across different nations and times. Many diverse properties of cities from patent production and personal income to electrical cable length are shown to be power law functions of population size with scaling exponents, beta, that fall into distinct universality classes. Quantities reflecting wealth creation and innovation have beta approximately 1.2 {$>$}1 (increasing returns), whereas those accounting for infrastructure display beta approximately 0.8 {$<$}1 (economies of scale). We predict that the pace of social life in the city increases with population size, in quantitative agreement with data, and we discuss how cities are similar to, and differ from, biological organisms, for which beta{$<$}1. Finally, we explore possible consequences of these scaling relations by deriving growth equations, which quantify the dramatic difference between growth fueled by innovation versus that driven by economies of scale. This difference suggests that, as population grows, major innovation cycles must be generated at a continually accelerating rate to sustain growth and avoid stagnation or collapse.},

Here, I show how all cities may evolve according to a small set of basic principles that operate locally. A theoretical framework was developed to predict the average social, spatial, and infrastructural properties of cities as a set of scaling relations that apply to all urban systems. Confirmation of these predictions was observed for thousands of cities worldwide, from many urban systems at different levels of development. Measures of urban efficiency, capturing the balance between socioeconomic outputs and infrastructural costs, were shown to be independent of city size and might be a useful means to evaluate urban planning strategies.},

The Bid-rent Land Use Model (BLUM) is an agent based, spatial competition model utilizing unique utility curves for willingness to pay and incomes for budget constrained abilities to pay for each agent. The model structure, estimation, calibration, implementation, and validation are presented. With a single year of land use data available, the validation approach used the Kappa Index of Agreement to spatially check model outputs against base year control data while controlling for agreement by chance. The U.S. territory of Guam is used as the case study/proof of concept implementation for this model framework. Once calibrated, BLUM could solve the spatial competition problem on Guam in less than two minutes of processing time with over 90\% accuracy.},

  abstract = {Abstract This paper aims to present and test a methodology capable of determining the impact of urban scenarios and policies through the use of calibrated bid-rents of a spatial interaction model (SIM) as hedonic price estimators of the real estate houses. This approach responds to the increasing requirement of decision support systems to assess complex effects of urban policies because through linking the bid-rents with hedonic prices, it is possible to connect the quantity estimates of the spatial interaction models with the value estimates of the hedonic price approach. The combined methodology is applied to Terceira Island to assess the spatial and economic impact of the decrease in activity of Lajes Military Airfield on employment and on the real estate value of the island. The SIM distributes employment and population by the 31 zones of Terceira Island in the Azores given the distances between zones, the basic employment per zone, the average distances for commuting and shopping and the space available for urban activities. The model's friction parameters are iteratively calibrated to secure that estimated average commuting and shopping distances are equal to those observed in reality; bid-rents are also calibrated to guarantee that the demand for space in each zone does not overcomes the available sspace for urban activities per zone. The SIM is coded and integrated in MATLAB 2013a. Afterward, a hedonic price regression is estimated to explain house prices in relation to the calibrated bid-rents and house typologies. The effect of the Lajes Military Airfield drawdown is estimated by the SIM, which evaluates the impacts on employment and population, and a hedonic price regression is subsequently performed with the new SIM bid-rents,to appraise the new real estate value. Results show that the Lajes Military Airfield reduction of 750 basic employment will result not only in a decrease of 1552 total employments and 3502 of the 56,437 residents of the island but also in a loss of 55 million {\texteuro} in real estate value. The method has proved its usefulness and effectiveness for predicting the impacts of exogenous shocks in complex urban systems.},

As of 2021 10.1\% of Canadian households were in core housing need with 77\% being attributed exclusively to a lack of affordability, 10\% attributed to housing inadequacy or unsuitability, and an additional 13\% facing a combination of such issues. This is especially prominent in Ontario as 12.1\% of households were in core housing need (Gov't of Canada, 2022). Much of the shortage is attributed to an insufficient supply. The project is part of a multi-stakeholder initiative to create an assessment framework to value affordable housing projects, grounded in academic theory and practice. The purpose of this research is to develop a measurement framework to estimate the social, environmental, and indirect economic contributions of affordable and community-focused housing projects. Quantifying the social returns of investments will provide organizations a tool to justify budget allocation decisions and to advocate for government funding support.   The proposed framework is generated using the Common Approach to Impact Measurement (CAIM) Common Foundations, a set of 5 governing practices for developing impact measurements. The Common Foundations were used to select effective impact measurements for a wide range of housing projects. The CAIM is in early stages of development, but will be used by impact investors, social enterprises in Ontario, and is supported by the Canadian Social Finance Fund. The framework was informed by content analysis, a frequency analysis, and semi-structured interviews with professionals. As a proof of concept, the proposed framework was applied to a case study with the United Property Resource Corporation to understand what impact measures are relevant, cost effective to measure, with accessible data. The framework encourages practitioners to interpret the cost-effectiveness of measurement.   The proposed framework and case study application demonstrate the importance of accounting for social returns of affordable housing projects as opposed to simply reporting the economic costs. This research contributes to emerging literature in the areas of affordable housing valuation, social finance, and impact measurement. Future studies should consider gaining feedback from affordable housing tenants and indirect beneficiaries to create a more comprehensive indicator set.},

To causally estimate this effect, we use a rich urban-level data set, choose our controls using the post-double-selection methodology, and instrument human capital with the per capita number of historical educational institutions. We find that human capital positively impacts urban population, house price and wage growth. While an elastic housing supply reinforces the impact on urban growth, it reduces house price growth and wage gro have recxenlty confirmed wth.

Moreover, the results are stronger for the manufacturing sector than for the services sector. The paper concludes that this evidence suggests that deviations from perfect competition are likely explained by declining competition in the U.S., whereas these secular trends, such as heterogeneous technology adoption and the declining price of capital, are more likely at play in Europe.

Using time-series cross-section regressions we test for the forecastability of prices and excess returns using a number of independent variables. Price changes in one year tend to continue for more than one year in the same direction. The ratio of construction costs to price, changes in adult population and increases in real per capita income all are positively related to excess returns or price changes over the subsequent year. The results add weight to the argument that the market for single-family homes is inefficient.},

It analyzes quarterly state-level data over 1985-2002, focusing on the relationship between home prices and selected fundamental variables. Income per capita alone largely explains price changes in all but eight states; in the latter, large price movements are observed unrelated to the fundamentals. Results from a new survey of recent homebuyers in the Los Angeles, San Francisco, Boston, and Milwaukee metropolitan areas are reported. This survey replicates an almost identical 1988 survey and finds, as before, that buyers in most of these markets perceive little risk in their housing investment, have unrealistic expectations about future price increases, and hold economically implausible beliefs about home price behavior---findings consistent with a bubble. Prices in such markets could stall or decline, but only if such declines are simultaneous or spread to other markets are significant effects on the national economy likely.},

We extend a panel of U.S. states observed quarterly during the seventeen-year period, 1982 through 1999, to the thirty-seven year period, 1975 through 2012Q2. Using techniques reported previously, we impute the aggregate value of owner-occupied housing, the value of financial assets, and measures of aggregate consumption for each of the geographic units over time. We estimate regression models in levels, first differences and in error-correction form, relating per capita consumption to per capita income and wealth. We find a statistically significant and rather large effect of housing wealth upon household consumption. This effect is consistently larger than the effect of stock market wealth upon consumption. In our earlier version of this paper, we found that households increase their spending when house prices rise, but we found no significant decrease in consumption when house prices fall. The results presented here with the extended data now show that declines in house prices stimulate large and significant decreases in household spending. The elasticities implied by this work are large. An increase in real housing wealth comparable to the rise between 2001 and 2005 would, over the four years, push up household spending by a total of about 4.3\%. A decrease in real housing wealth comparable to the crash which took place between 2005 and 2009 would lead to a drop of about 3.5\%. DOI:10.1561/104.00000009}

In this context, I also analyse the implications of introducing a public education system.}

The procedure builds on Ackerberg, Caves and Frazer (2015) and Wooldridge (2009), but in addition, allows the productivity process to depend on the lagged output levels and input usages of related firms, and to accommodate spatially correlated productivity shocks across firms. The procedure provides the estimates of the production function parameters (the capital and labor shares in value-added, and the degree of serial correlation in the productivity process), and the spatial dependence parameters (of productivity on related firms{\^a}{\texteuro}‚Ñ¢ past outputs and inputs, and current innovation shocks), where the set of related firms can differ across the three dimensions of spatial dependence. We establish the asymptotic properties of the proposed estimator, and conduct Monte Carlo simulations to validate these properties. In particular, our proposed estimator is consistent under DGPs with or without spatial dependence. In contrast, the conventional estimators are biased when the true DGPs are indeed characterized by spatial dependence.},

While the distribution of wealth varies across countries based on their economic stages, there is a universal trend observed in the distribution function. Typically, regions with lower wealth values exhibit an exponential distribution, while regions with higher wealth values demonstrate a power-law distribution. In this review, we introduce measures that effectively capture wealth inequality and examine wealth distribution functions within the wealth exchange model. Drawing inspiration from the field of econophysics, wealth exchange resulting from economic activities is likened to a kinetic model, where molecules collide and exchange energy. Within this framework, two agents exchange a specific amount of wealth. As we delve into the analysis, we investigate the impact of various factors such as tax collection, debt allowance, and savings on the wealth distribution function when wealth is exchanged. These factors play a crucial role in shaping the dynamics of wealth distribution.},

A growing body of scholarship considers how the ownership of such assets by individuals and households is reshaping patterns of class and inequality and accordingly requires the reconceptualisation of the latter phenomena. The significance of company-owned assets and corporate rents for class, inequality and their conceptualisation has not been considered, however. This article offers an exploratory investigation along these lines, highlighting the importance of employees' working relationship to company-owned, rent-generating assets for their class position. The article further reflects on how developments in this regard might be approached from the perspective of Marx's writing on value, labour and class, and the challenges that those developments potentially pose to Marxian concepts.},

In the spirit of fostering a constructive dialogue, this article develops a broadly based critique of such accounts, one structured around the core idea of limits. Financialization, it suggests, is substantively limited, both as a concept and as the array of real-world processes to which that concept variously pertains. The article identifies and fleshes out five key sets of such limits and the connections between them: analytic, theoretic, strategic, optic, and empiric limits. If the concept of financialization is to do substantially positive descriptive and explanatory work going forward, the article submits, these limits must be explicitly recognized and their implications explicitly factored in.

This article explores and substantiates Harvey's argument by returning to the thesis of capital switching that Harvey, following Henri Lefebvre, initially expounded in the 1970s and 1980s. The nub of this argument was that as capitalist production edges toward periodic crises of overaccumulation, capital "switches" from production per se into production of the urban built environment as a means to absorb surplus capital and hence avert-if only temporarily-crisis. Although Harvey's thesis has proven extremely influential among political economists, urban theorists, and geographers of various stripes, previous attempts to buttress it with empirical evidence have failed to unearth any demonstrable switching dynamic of the kind Harvey theorizes. This article analyzes data for the years leading up to 2007 and the unfolding of the current economic crisis. Focusing primarily on the United Kingdom, it presents two separate analyses that suggest a clear pattern of capital switching into the built environment since the turn of the millennium: first, a switching of overall private-sector expenditures and, second, a switching of pension fund investment. Together, the analyses place urbanization, following Harvey, at the heart of contemporary economic crisis.},

The most important concerns are about endogeneity at the local and individual levels, the choice of a productivity measure between wages and total-factor productivity, and the roles of spatial scale, firms' characteristics, and functional forms. Estimated impacts of local determinants of productivity, employment, and firms' location choices are surveyed for both developed and developing economies.

Yet the addition of the chapter to the third edition of Ricardo's               Principles of Political Economy and Taxation               arguably overturns much of the view for which Ricardo is so well known (Davis 1989). In the added chapter Ricardo allows, contrary to his original view in the first two editions, that the introduction of machinery is indeed injurious to the class of laborers. More interestingly, because machinery substitutes for labor, wages cannot rise and profits are no longer threatened by rising rents. Effectively the contest between capitalists and landlords of the first two editions of the               Principles               is replaced in the final edition by one between capitalists and laborers. However, not only does the ``On Machinery`` chapter substantially change the distributional argument customarily attributed to the               Principles               , but it also permits an examination of Ricardo's thinking about distribution in two distinct, but related frameworks. The discussion here compares the distributional analysis in the first two editions with that of the third to explain the general nature of the Ricardo's theory of profit. It does so by providing a novel interpretation of Ricardo's characterization of profit as a residual, and by emphasizing the historical context in which distribution occurred in the beginning of the nineteenth century.},

Using a large panel of worker-level data from Britain, we first demonstrate the existence of an urban premium for wage levels, which increases in city size. We next provide evidence of a city size premium on wage growth, but show that this effect is driven purely by the increase in wage that occurs in the first year that a worker moves to a larger location. Controlling for sorting on the basis of unobservables we find no evidence of an urban wage growth premium. Experience in cities does have some impact on wage growth, however. Specifically, we show that workers who have at some point worked in a city experience faster wage growth than those who have never worked in a city.},

They allow for a new paradigm of city planning and for an understanding of urban resilience and economics. The emergence of these power-law relations is still unclear. Improving our understanding of their origin will help us to better apply them in practical applications and further research their properties. In this work, we derive the basic exponents for spatially distributed variables from fundamental fractal geometric relations in cities. Sub-linear scaling arises as the ratio of the fractal dimension of the road network and of the distribution of the population embedded in three dimensions. Super-linear scaling emerges from human interactions that are constrained by the geometry of a city. We demonstrate the validity of the framework with data from 4750 European cities. We make several testable predictions, including the relation of average height of cities and population size, and the existence of a critical density above which growth changes from horizontal densification to three-dimensional growth.}

The observation at the macroscopic level demonstrates that the aggregated urban quantities (e.g., gross domestic product) scale systematically with population sizes across cities, also known as urban scaling laws. However, at the mesoscopic level, we lack an understanding of whether the simple scaling relationship holds within cities, which is a fundamental question regarding the spatial origin of scaling in urban systems. Here, by analyzing four extensive~datasets covering millions of mobile phone users and urban facilities, we investigate the scaling phenomena within cities. We find that the mesoscopic infrastructure volume and socioeconomic activity scale sub- and super-linearly with the active population, respectively. For a same scaling phenomenon, however, the exponents vary in cities of similar population sizes. To explain these empirical observations, we propose a conceptual framework by considering the heterogeneous distributions of population and facilities, and the spatial interactions between them. Analytical and numerical results suggest that, despite the large number of complexities that influence urban activities, the simple interaction rules can effectively explain the observed regularity and heterogeneity in scaling behaviors within cities.},

  abstract = {Commuting is a key mechanism that governs the dynamics of cities. Despite its importance, very little is known of the properties and mechanisms underlying this crucial urban process. Here, we capitalize on \${\textbackslash}sim\$ 50 million individuals' smartphone data from 234 Chinese cities to show that urban commuting obeys remarkable regularities. These regularities can be generalized as two laws: (i) the scale-invariance of the average commuting distance across cities, which is a long-awaited validation of Marchetti's constant conjecture, and (ii) a universal inverted U-shape of the commuting distance as a function of the distance from the city centre within cities, indicating that the city centre's attraction is bounded. Motivated by such empirical findings, we develop a simple urban growth model that connects individual-level mobility choices with macroscopic urban spatial structure and faithfully explains both commuting laws. Our results further show that the scale-invariants of human mobility will ultimately lead to the polycentric transition in cities, which could be used to better inform urban development strategies.},

To these questions, the urban growth literature has offered a variety of answers. Within an integrated framework, this chapter reviews key theories with implications for urban growth. It then relates these theories to empirical evidence on the main drivers of city growth, drawn primarily from the United States and other developed countries. Consistent with the monocentric city model, fewer roads and restrictions on housing supply hinder urban growth. The fact that housing is durable also has important effects on the evolution of cities. In recent decades, cities with better amenities have grown faster. Agglomeration economies and human capital are also important drivers of city growth. Although more human capital, smaller firms, and a greater diversity in production foster urban growth, the exact channels through which those effects percolate are not clearly identified. Finally, shocks also determine the fate of cities. Structural changes affecting the broader economy have left a big footprint on the urban landscape. Small city-specific shocks also appear to matter, consistent with the recent wave of random growth models.},

In some instances, there is a wedge between the private costs (or benefits) resulting from some choice made by an economic agent and the social costs (or benefits) accruing to society. Such a wedge occurs when markets fail to mediate properly some economic interactions; that is, when there is an externality. In such a case, the privately optimal decision made by the agent does not lead to a socially optimal outcome. For instance, investors underinvest when they cannot appropriate all the positive returns from their investments. Firms overproduce goods, whose production damages the environment at no cost to them, and so on. Pigou's (1920) ingenious solution to this type of problem is to impose a tax (or a subsidy) so that the private and social costs are made equal. In other words, whenever there is an externality, an appropriately chosen Pigovian tax or subsidy can make agents internalize the external effects of their choices so that the privately optimal decision leads to a socially optimal outcome. After exposing the details of this argument, the Econ101 textbook typically points out that such taxes and subsidies are difficult to implement empirically because of their informational requirements. Then the textbook usually ends the discussion on this topic and turns to something else. From a policy perspective,},

Compared with European cities, US cities are half as accessible via public transit and twice as accessible via cars.

However, US cities' car orientation comes at the cost of less green space, more congestion, and worse health and pollution externalities.},

We provide an explicit economic mechanism whereby ICT is more complementary with labor at larger firms. Quantitatively, we find that with such a complementarity, the observed decline in ICT prices alone can account for most of the urban-biased growth, since Business Services firms in big cities tend to be large.},

Here we review some of the di erent purposes for a simulation model of complex social phenomena, focusing on seven in particular: prediction, explanation, description, theoretical exploration, illustration, analogy, and social interaction. The paper looks at some of the implications in terms of the ways in which the intended purpose might fail. This analysis motivates some of the ways in which these `dangers' might be avoided or mitigated. It also looks at the ways that a confusion of modelling purposes can fatally weaken modelling projects, whilst giving a false sense of their quality. These distinctions clarify some previous debates as to the best modelling strategy (e.g. KISS and KIDS). The paper ends with a plea for modellers to be clear concerning which purpose they are justifying their model against.},

Yet there is relatively little sustained engagement with research on financialized capitalism in community development circles. Bringing together writers and activists from a variety of contexts, the purpose of this special issue is to demonstrate the significance of financialization and its connections, on various levels, to community development globally. This introductory article synthesizes the insights of our contributors with scholarship from the fields of critical political economy, economic and historical sociology, and social movement studies, among others. In doing so, it analyses the diverse and variegated ways financialized capitalism is affecting communities' access to public resources, affordable housing, safe and stable livelihoods, and a clean and healthy environment. We also highlight how the complexity and depth of financialization, and the extent to which it relies on highly specialized and inaccessible forms of knowledge to reproduce itself, impacts on community development as a form of praxis. The institutional cover provided to the system of finance by states and international financial institutions, and by certain NGOs and community organizations, has deeply embedded financialization at macro, micro and meso levels of the economy and society. However, while financialization places profound and often insurmountable constraints on community development's democratic ideals, some of our contributors have pointed to possible ways forward. These are characterized by intensive popular education, political engagement and action. We also outline these in the hope that the special issue will contribute to more discussion of these vital processes and stimulate further purposive action.},

This article examines the economic geography of talent, exploring the factors that attract talent and its effects on high-technology industry and regional incomes. Talent is defined as individuals with high levels of human capital, measured as the percentage of the population with a bachelor's degree and above. This article advances the hypothesis that talent is attracted by diversity, or what are referred to as low barriers to entry for human capital. To get at this, it introduces a new measure of diversity, referred to as the diversity index, measured as the proportion of gay households in a region. It also introduces a new measure of cultural and nightlife amenities, the coolness index, as well as employing conventional measures of amenities, high-technology industry, and regional income. Statistical research supported by the findings of interviews and focus groups is used to probe these issues. The findings confirm the hypothesis and shed light on both the factors associated with the economic geography of talent and its effects on regional development. The economic geography of talent is highly concentrated. Talent is associated with the diversity index. Furthermore, the economic geography of talent is strongly associated with high-technology industry location. Talent and high-technology industry work independently and together to generate higher regional incomes. In short, talent is a key intermediate variable in attracting high-technology industries and generating higher regional incomes.},

In this setting, the consumption and saving decisions of city residents are determined jointly with their choice of location, thereby offering an initial step to understanding how housing services influence non-durable consumption, and vice versa. Housing, supplied by profit-maximizing land owners, is distinguished from more non-descript varieties of durable consumption by the attributes and amenities it provides occupants. These attributes are limited in supply, indivisible, and distinguished by their location in geographic space and time of development. In equilibrium, both household consumption and the rental price of housing are expressed in terms of the resident household's permanent income. In contrast to models presuming hand-to-mouth dynamics, dwelling rents depend on interest rates, future realizations of economic fundamentals such as income and commuting costs, and accumulated wealth. Finally, residential saving is determined not only by wealth, income, and market prices, but also by city-specific factors such as population, supply constraints, and the opportunity cost of land, suggesting a novel and important role for regional and geographic differences in consumer behavior.},

Using new tools--in particular, modeling techniques developed to analyze industrial organization, international trade, and economic growth--this "new economic geography" has emerged as one of the most exciting areas of contemporary economics. The authors show how seemingly disparate models reflect a few basic themes, and in so doing they develop a common "grammar" for discussing a variety of issues.

Previous theoretical work on the subject is sparse and explains why some landlords charge below-market rents, not stickiness. Apart from its interest for understanding housing markets and overall inflation, rent stickiness is intriguing because it shows that stickiness can emerge in markets where the typical menu cost logic does not apply, and where market participants typically engage in repeated bargaining over contracts. Our model involves search and bargaining with incomplete information in a two-period game, and generates stickiness in a novel manner. The key decision is the landlord's choice of whether to renegotiate, or not. Crucially, landlords do not know tenant perceptions of unit quality. The key force generating stickiness is that offering the identical contract preempts tenant search, thus limiting tenants' outside options, and resolves uncertainty early. Risk aversion reinforces this mechanism and yields differential stickiness by landlord type. Renegotiation risk for large landlords disappears because the different outcomes---rent increase, rent decrease, and vacancy---``average out.'' Landlords who manage only one unit loathe vacancy, and are highly motivated to avoid renegotiation.},

We challenge this orthodox theory by highlighting two limitations in demystifying patterns of urban land redevelopment and rural land use utility in transitional China. Empirical evidence shows that distance still matters to both urban and rural land use transition. However, the property-oriented and scale-sensitive functional structure of redevelopment is not exactly what Alonso suggested. The temptation of urbanization, coupled with the resistance of rural revitalization, results in an inverted bid-rent curve in terms of the utilization of rural housing land. The dual-track nature of both urban--rural household registration (hukou) and land use systems contributes a lot for these unconventional findings. We can therefore summarize that transition of land use in both urban and rural China is largely institutionally driven, and the Chinese government is the dominant agent of creating a unique trajectory of spatial restructuring.},

The mean elasticity conditional on the absence of these issues is 0.3. To obtain this result, we collect 3,186 estimates of the elasticity reported in 121 studies, codify 71 variables that reflect the context in which researchers produce their estimates, and address model uncertainty by Bayesian and frequentist model averaging. We employ nonlinear techniques to correct for publication bias, which is responsible for at least half of the overall reduction in the mean elasticity from 0.9 to 0.3. Our findings also suggest that a failure to normalize the production function leads to a substantial upward bias in the estimated elasticity. The weight of evidence accumulated in the empirical literature emphatically rejects the Cobb-Douglas specification.},

The decline in claim disputes after the turn of the century reduced the value of full title, and the demand for patents decreased.

  abstract = {Urban scaling relations characterizing how diverse properties of cities vary on average with their population size have recently been shown to be a general quantitative property of many urban systems around the world. However, in previous studies the statistics of urban indicators were not analyzed in detail, raising important questions about the full characterization of urban properties and how scaling relations may emerge in these larger contexts. Here, we build a self-consistent statistical framework that characterizes the joint probability distributions of urban indicators and city population sizes across an urban system. To develop this framework empirically we use one of the most granular and stochastic urban indicators available, specifically measuring homicides in cities of Brazil, Colombia and Mexico, three nations with high and fast changing rates of violent crime. We use these data to derive the conditional probability of the number of homicides per year given the population size of a city. To do this we use Bayes' rule together with the estimated conditional probability of city size given their number of homicides and the distribution of total homicides. We then show that scaling laws emerge as expectation values of these conditional statistics. Knowledge of these distributions implies, in turn, a relationship between scaling and population size distribution exponents that can be used to predict Zipf's exponent from urban indicator statistics. Our results also suggest how a general statistical theory of urban indicators may be constructed from the stochastic dynamics of social interaction processes in cities.},

We have systematically evaluated existing uses of the ODD protocol and identified, as expected, parts of ODD needing improvement and clarification. Accordingly, we revise the definition of ODD to clarify aspects of the original version and thereby facilitate future standardization of ABM descriptions. We discuss frequently raised critiques in ODD but also two emerging, and unanticipated, benefits: ODD improves the rigorous formulation of models and helps make the theoretical foundations of large models more visible. Although the protocol was designed for ABMs, it can help with documenting any large, complex model, alleviating some general objections against such models.},

However, there is no standard protocol for describing such simulation models, which can make them difficult to understand and to duplicate. This paper presents a proposed standard protocol, ODD, for describing IBMs and ABMs, developed and tested by 28 modellers who cover a wide range of fields within ecology. This protocol consists of three blocks (Overview, Design concepts, and Details), which are subdivided into seven elements: Purpose, State variables and scales, Process overview and scheduling, Design concepts, Initialization, Input, and Submodels. We explain which aspects of a model should be described in each element, and we present an example to illustrate the protocol in use. In addition, 19 examples are available in an Online Appendix. We consider ODD as a first step for establishing a more detailed common format of the description of IBMs and ABMs. Once initiated, the protocol will hopefully evolve as it becomes used by a sufficiently large proportion of modellers.},

The paper provides an initial empirical test of the Lerman and Kern modifications, using household level data from Bogota, Colombia. The results of the model are evaluated by comparing forecasted bid-rents to actual rents and forecasted dwelling occupants to actual occupants, by examining the demand prices which emerge from the analysis and by comparing the results to previous housing demand research which uses a hedonic-type approach to analyze identical data. The findings of the study show that the bid-rent model works reasonably well in its predictions and in its estimates of the demand for attributes and, in some ways, it may perform better than a hedonic-type model in forecasting the demand for housing attributes.},

This conceptual framework, referred to as ``the new economic geography,'' aims to identify the determinants of when cities will coalesce and of the size distribution of urban places in a country or region. The conditions identified by the model as being conducive to the formation of cities include declining transportation costs, rising demand for goods produced under increasing returns to scale, and a preference for variety in the commodities and services households buy. The second part of the chapter shows that these conditions came into much greater effect in the United States during the years between 1815 and about 1850 than they had been before. The chapter concludes with a theoretical consideration of where on the map urbanization is likely to take place.},

  abstract = {This article reviews macroeconomic models with heterogeneous households. A key question for the relevance of these models concerns the degree to which markets are complete. This is because the existence of complete markets imposes restrictions on (i) how much heterogeneity matters for aggregate phenomena and (ii) the types of cross-sectional distributions that can be obtained. The degree of market incompleteness, in turn, depends on two factors: (i) the richness of insurance opportunities provided by the economic environment and (ii) the nature and magnitude of idiosyncratic risks to be insured. First, I review a broad collection of empirical evidence--from econometric tests of "full insurance," to quantitative and empirical analyses of the permanent income ("self-insurance") model that examine how it fits the facts about life cycle allocations, to studies that try to directly measure where economies place between these two benchmarks ("partial insurance"). The empirical evidence I survey reveals significant uncertainty in the profession regarding the magnitudes of idiosyncratic risks as well as whether or not these risks have increased since the 1970s. An important difficulty stems from the fact that inequality often arises from a mixture of idiosyncratic risk and fixed (or predictable) heterogeneity, making the two challenging to disentangle. I also discuss applications of incomplete markets models to trends in wealth, consumption, and earnings inequality both over the life cycle and over time, where this challenge is evident. Third, I discuss "approximate" aggregation--the finding that some incomplete markets models generate aggregate implications very similar to representative-agent models. What approximate aggregation does and does not imply is illustrated through several examples. Finally, I discuss some computational issues relevant for solving and calibrating such models and I provide a simple yet fully parallelizable global optimization algorithm that can be used to calibrate heterogeneous agent models.},

The typical beliefs, claims, and tenets of each phase are reconstructed and discussed, and the transition from one phase to another is analyzed. In order to facilitate and incite further discussion the present, that is third, phase is purposefully construed in terms of two rival lines of thought: the idiographic line (that denies the possibility of a general theory of land rent, advocating instead the analysis of concrete situations), and the nomothetic line (that searches for general laws).

  abstract = {This paper employs data from the National Association of Realtors to analyze the time series and cross sectional patterns of bidding wars for houses. The paper generates a number of novel stylized facts. Bidding wars -- where multiple buyers compete for a house and push its sales price above list price -- were once rare, a fairly constant 3-4\% of housing sales. This led to treating the list price as a ceiling in empirical and theoretical research on housing transactions. The paper shows that bidding wars have become much more common during the recent housing boom, more than tripling as a share of housing sales between 1995-2005. The share of sales involving bidding wars has fallen during the subsequent bust, but it remains approximately twice as high as it was before the boom. Overall, the paper shows the incidence of bidding wars to be higher in circumstances associated with general macroeconomic and specific housing booms. However, bidding war frequency varies considerably by city, with the share in some cities rising to more than 30\% during the boom and the share in other cities rising hardly at all. This variation, and also the rarity of bidding wars during past booms, suggests that the recent growth of bidding wars is not simply a boom phenomenon. The paper also considers -- at the MSA and individual housing transaction levels -- other potential contributing factors, including buyer irrationality, the use of the internet in home purchases, and land use regulation.}

When finance became a master rent seeking, cultural capture and out-of-control financial innovation resulted in financial and social instability. Finance as a master was the characteristic of finance capitalism from around 1900--1931 and of financialization from around 1980 to today. Finance capitalism and financialization were enabled by a dominant narrative that legitimized the power of finance. The shifts in the role of finance happened when crises undermined the meaning of the existing narrative and created for a new narrative able to make sense of the crisis and point society in a new direction. This sense-making process stabilized when a new narrative was established that could explain the crisis and legitimize and shape a new role for finance.

In fact, assessment data show that between 1899 and 1913 the local proportion of owner-occupied dwellings rose by about 20 percentage points. Among the middle class, changes in the domestic division of labour were associated with an increase in ownership aspirations, while smaller and cheaper homes were becoming acceptable. Among workers, a housing shortage and rapid rent increases forced families to acquire a home at any cost. Many followed the factories, building shacks at the suburban fringe. The experience of Toronto challenges the assumption, common among geographers and historians, that prior to World War I suburban home ownership was overwhelmingly a middle class phenomenon. It also shows that homes must be viewed as places of domestic production as well as of consumption.},

Ce{\c c}i permet de mettre {\`a} l'int{\'e}rieur d'une perspective th{\'e}orique coh{\'e}rente les `long cycles' d'investissement observ{\'e}s, ainsi que les changements ge{\'o}graphique des fluxes d'investissements. Ensuite la mani{\`e}re dont le cadre b{\^a}ti lui-m{\^e}me exprime et contribu aux crises capitalistes est examin{\'e}e. Il est demontr{\'e} que sous le capitalisme il existe une lutte perpetuelle selon laquelle le capital essaye de construire un environnement propre {\`a} son image seulement pour le d{\'e}truire avec la r{\'e}apparition d'une nouvelle crise. L'analyse consid{\`e}re alors comment la lutte de classes---c'est {\`a} dire la r{\'e}action organis{\'e}e de la force du travail aux d{\'e}pr{\'e}dations du capital---influence la direction et la forme de l'investissement dans le cadre b{\^a}ti.

  abstract = {Globalization is widely held to circumscribe the parameters of political and economic choice in contemporary Europe, just as it has come to circumscribe the parameters of debate on the future of European models of capitalism. Yet opinions on the question of convergence nonetheless vary markedly, with proponents of the hyperglobalization thesis pointing to a simple and inexorable process of neoliberal convergence while an increasingly influential school of neo-institutionalists point to a rather more complex process of 'dual' or 'co-convergence', reinforcing the distinctiveness of liberal and coordinated market economies. In both accounts, the exhibited pattern of convergence (dual or otherwise) is seen to be driven by globalization. In this paper I provide a theoretical and empirical critique of this important literature, challenging the contextualization of the question of convergence with respect to globalization which both perspectives share. I advance a distinctive variant of the new institutionalism which emphasizes: (i) the contingency of any process of convergence observed; (ii) the frequently political as opposed to economic nature of convergent tendencies; (iii) the counter-tendencies which might be mobilized to such tendencies; and (iv) the invariably far greater significance, in the establishment of common trajectories, of regional rather than genuinely global processes of integration. Though common trajectories are discernible within contemporary Europe, associated in particular with the institutional architecture of EMU and an accelerating process of European economic integration, they have been embraced more or less enthusiastically and at variable paces, leading not to convergent but to divergent outcomes.},

We extract built-up clusters from early historical maps, identify settlements at the onset of the nineteenth century, and isolate exogenous variation in the nature of their rise during the transformation of the economy by the end of the nineteenth century. We then estimate the causal impact of cities' population and industrial specialization on their later dynamics. We find that cities specializing in a small number of industries decline in the long run. We develop a dynamic spatial model of cities to isolate the forces which govern their life and death. Intratemporally, the model captures the role of amenities, land, local productivity and trade in explaining the distribution of economic activity across industries and cities. Intertemporally, the model can disentangle the role of aggregate industry dynamics from city-specific externalities. We find that the long-run dynamics of English and Welsh cities is explained to a large extent by such dynamic externalities a la Jacobs.},

The paper focuses on the different sizes and types of cities generated by market forces and whether these market forces generate optimally size cities. Before the model is presented, four complex questions are naively answered, revealing the most basic concepts underlying the paper and intellectual debts to the existing literature. First the model of a single city is presented. How factor rewards and cost of living vary with city size is analysed. Given these results, the paper presents an analysis of market equilibrium and optimum city size. Finally, equilibrium in an economy with multiple types of cities is examined. At the end of the paper, we discuss how natural resources and transportation costs in trade can be integrated into the model. Throughout the paper, it is assumed that capital and labour are scarce resources and perfectly mobile within the economy. The economy is situated on a flat featureless plain, large enough so that land per se is never a scarce resource (although location will be a scarce resource). This non-critical assumption implies the opportunity cost of land is zero. Lastly, there are no specified transport costs of inter-city trade.},

The key idea is to infer the distribution of preference parameters from the observed age profile of wealth inequality. The contribution of preference heterogeneity to wealth inequality can then be measured using a quantitative life-cycle model. I find that discount rate heterogeneity increases the Gini coefficient of wealth by around 0.07 to levels that are close to the data. The share of wealth held by the richest 1\% of households rises by around 0.04, but falls short of the data by more than 10 percentage points. Discount rate heterogeneity also helps to account for the large wealth inequality observed among households with similar lifetime earnings.},

This allows us to derive empirically based projections for r - g beyond the next five or ten years. Our projections suggest that r - g remains negative for the next two decades in most European countries that we study, but not in the United States. The debt-carrying capacity of governments in Europe is structurally higher now than in recent decades. This allows to worry less about public debt, but does not exempt policy makers from the task to strongly monitor their expenditures and balances, given major challenges ahead.},

  abstract = {In the literature, it is argued that the Fordist regime of accumulation has gradually been replaced by a finance-driven regime. We argue that the contemporary regime in the UK could be best characterized as a finance- and real estate-driven regime. Like Fordism, the new regime is thought to fuel the economy by propping up consumption, but unlike the Fordist regime it does not seek to do so through job creation or high and steady wages, but rather through private money creation and real estate price inflation. The reliance of the economy on private housing debt rather than public debt---`privatized Keynesianism' (Crouch, 2011)---is a key element of the new regime. The state has not simply facilitated the rise of the new regime but has put its faith in the financial and real estate sectors---both residential and commercial---to prop up the economy. Different layers of the UK government have favoured real estate development and investment, in part enabled by disintermediation and lobbying. For a while, the finance- and real estate-driven regime seemed to create economic growth. Although the regime appeared fragile during the financial crisis of 2007--2009, the neoliberal mode and its accompanying finance- and real estate-driven regime were saved and the dominance of finance and real estate have deepened. This paper is based on the analysis of publicly available statistics, policy and advocacy documents and 39 in-depth interviews with real estate professionals.},

In general, the rates were found to be very high. Factors influencing or correlated with the personal rates of time preference were investigated through regression methods. OLS was the technique used in the estimation. Market imperfections, particularly in credit and insurance markets lead to variation in RTPs. Poverty in assets, or cash liquidity constraints, was leading to or correlated with higher rates of time preference. The poor are, therefore, less likely to invest in environmental conservation. In Zambia, independent estimates of risk preferences were made. More risk-averse people tended to have lower RTPs. The results support the hypothesis that poverty and/or liquidity scarcity lead to high RTPs. Poverty reduction may thus reduce the RTPs of the poor and reduce the 'intertemporal externality' due to high RTPs. The high average RTPs indicate, however, that complementary policies may be needed to ensure sufficient levels of investment in conservation. Another logical implication is that institutionalization of private property rights may not be a sufficient tool to initiate sustainable resource management.},

This paper describes a bidding model that incorporates these characteristics of housing markets.

We show how older Americans evaluate simple (hypothetical) inter-temporal choices in which payments today are compared with payments in the future. Using the indicators derived from this measure, we then demonstrate that differences in discounting patterns are associated with characteristics of particular importance in elderly populations. For example, cognitive deficits are associated with greater impatience, whereas bequest motives are associated with less impatience. We then relate our discounting measure to key economic outcomes and find that impatience is associated with lower wealth, fewer investments in health, and less planning for end of life care.},

The difference between aggregate final-good production and these resources is referred to as net output. The new generalized steady-state growth theorem holds since net output exhibits constant returns to scale in capital and labor. This insight provides an understanding for why technical change is labor-augmenting in steady state even if capital-augmenting technical change is feasible. By example, this point is made for three recent growth models that allow for endogenous capital- and labor-augmenting technical change, namely, Irmen (2013), Acemoglu (2003), and Acemoglu (2009), Chapter 15. The reduced form of these models is shown to be consistent with the generalized steady-state growth theorem.}

  abstract = {Whilst real estate capital became a driving force in analyses of urban development, urban land rent theory has made only very limited progress during the past decade. There are a number of reasons for this -- such as a weak conceptualization of the role of political agency, for example. Hence, a way out of this relative stagnation, by attempting to systematically develop an integrated view on structure and agency in the context of urban land rent, is offered in this article. Advances in critical theory, thinking about space and dialectic reasoning contribute to the development of a new perspective on land rent. Land rent is conceptualized as a middle-range theory. In order to bring together concrete urban phenomena with the general process of political-economic development, a systematic link between land rent theory and the theoretical apparatus of the French Regulation School is developed. The reformulation of land rent theory from a regulationist perspective underlines the importance of the institutional context (and its changes) for an understanding of rent and its role in the urban context. In so doing, land rent theory proves to be a very useful tool for providing an integrated political-economic perspective for analyses of urban phenomena. This is illustrated briefly in the cases of Vienna and Montevideo. Si le capital immobilier est devenu un point central des analyses du d{\'e}veloppement urbain, la th{\'e}orie n'a gu{\`e}re progress{\'e} au cours de la derni{\`e}re d{\'e}cennie. Plusieurs facteurs sont en cause, telle la faible conceptualisation du r{\^o}le politique d'agence. Cet article propose donc une porte de sortie {\`a} cette relative stagnation, en tentant de construire syst{\'e}matiquement une vision int{\'e}gr{\'e}e de la structure et l'agence dans le cadre de la rente urbaine. Les progr{\`e}s en mati{\`e}re de th{\'e}orie critique, r{\'e}flexion en termes d'espace et raisonnement dialectique facilitent l'{\'e}laboration d'une nouvelle perspective sur la location fonci{\`e}re, laquelle est conceptualis{\'e}e en tant que th{\'e}orie interm{\'e}diaire. Afin de regrouper ph{\'e}nom{\`e}nes urbains concrets et processus g{\'e}n{\'e}ral d'am{\'e}nagement politico-{\'e}conomique, une relation syst{\'e}matique est {\'e}tablie entre la th{\'e}orie sur la rente fonci{\`e}re et l'appareil th{\'e}orique de l'{\'E}cole Fran{\c c}aise de R{\'e}gulation. Reformuler la th{\'e}orie sur la rente fonci{\`e}re d'un point de vue r{\'e}gulationiste souligne combien le contexte institutionnel (et ses changements) est important pour comprendre la rente et son r{\^o}le dans le cadre urbain. Ce faisant, la th{\'e}orie sur la rente fonci{\`e}re se r{\'e}v{\`e}le un outil tr{\`e}s utile pour cr{\'e}er une perspective politico-{\'e}conomique int{\'e}gr{\'e}e permettant d'analyser les ph{\'e}nom{\`e}nes urbains.

By contrast, how cities vary in their age structure and the potential implications of this for their economic growth has been a hitherto largely neglected research area. Using novel data from a variety of historical and contemporary sources, we first show that there is marked variation in the age structure of the world's largest cities, both across cities and over time. We then study how age structure affects economic growth for a global cross-section of mega-cities and find that mega-cities with higher dependency ratios - i.e. with more children and/or seniors per working-age adult - grow slower. Overall, and despite the many data and econometric challenges posed by this type of analysis, we advocate for more research on the subject given its importance.},

We all agree that the basic requirement of any model is that it should be capable of explaining the characteristic features of the economic process as we find them in reality. It is no good starting off a model with the kind of abstraction which initially excludes the influence of forces which are mainly responsible for the behaviour of the economic variables under investigation; and upon finding that the theory leads to results contrary to what we observe in reality, attributing this contrary movement to the compensating (or more than compensating) influence of residual factors that have been assumed away in the model. In dealing with capital accumulation and economic growth, we are only too apt to begin by assuming a `given state of knowledge' (that is to say, absence of technical progress) and the absence of `uncertainty', and content ourselves with saying that these two factors --- technical progress and uncertainty --- must have been responsible for the difference between theoretical expectation and the recorded facts of experience. The interpretative value of this kind of theory must of necessity be extremely small.},

Kaplan avoids the bitter disputes among people doing methodology, claiming instead that what is important are those qualities intrinsic to the overall aspirations of the social sciences. He deals with special problems of various disciplines only so far as may be helpful in clarifying the general method of inquiry.The Conduct of Inquiry is a systematic, rounded, and wide-ranging inquiry into behavioral science. Kaplan is guided by the experience of sciences with longer histories, but he is bound neither to their problems nor to their solutions. Instead, he addresses the methodology of behavioral science in the broad sense of both method and science. The work is not a formal exercise in the philosophy of science but rather a critical and constructive assessment of the developing standards and strategies of contemporary social inquiry. He emphasizes the tasks, achievements, limitations, and dilemmas of the newer disciplines.Philosophers of science usually choose to write about the most fully developed sciences because problems are clearer there. The result is ordinarily of little benefit to the behavioral scientist, whose task is clarification of method; here the precedents and analogies of physical science are obscure or inappropriate. The Conduct of Inquiry goes a long way in drawing upon the strengths of social research insights without simplifying the common concerns of the scientific enterprise as a whole. As Leonard Broom noted when the book initially appeared: "Kaplan fills a gap and does so with admirable clarity and often engaging wit. It lacks pomposity, pedantry, and pretension, and it is bound to make an impact on the teaching of and, with luck, research in the behavioral sciences."},

The main finding of the model suggests that improved market access with respect to an external market enhances the Home Market Effect within the system of the two regions.

Recently, several empirical studies and emerging theory provided support for the fact that many different urban indicators follow general consistent statistical patterns across countries, cultures and times. In particular, total personal income, measures of innovation, crime rates, characteristics of the built environment and other indicators have been shown to exhibit non-linear power-law scaling with the population size of functional cities. Here, we show how to apply this type of analysis inside cities to establish universal patterns in the quantity and distribution of urban amenities such as restaurants, parks, and universities. Using a unique data set containing millions of amenities in the 50 largest US metropolitan areas, we establish general non-linear scaling patterns between each city's population and many different amenities types, the small-area statistics of their spatial abundance, and the characteristics of their mean distance to each other. We use these size-specific statistical findings to produce generative models for the expected amenity abundances of any US city. We then compute the deviations observed in given cities from this statistical many-amenity model to build a characteristic signature for each urban area. Finally, we show how urban planning can be guided by these systemic quantitative expectations in the context of new city design or the identification of local deficits in service provision in existing cities.},

The recession had profound effects in regional economies, which showed diverse performance based on their capacity to absorb the shock. The concept of economic resilience has been brought to the center of attention with several contributions exploring its determinants. However, the impact of the embeddedness of local economic systems in terms of sales and supplies has been largely unexplored. We use regional input-output tables to approximate the embeddedness of local economies between and, fixed-effects and quantile regressions to test its relationship to regional resistance between 2008 and 2011. We find that during the GR, regional industries opted to change input rather than output markets. Additionally, embeddedness has a curvilinear relationship to regional resistance which varies across the distribution of regional resistance performance. Finally, at the industry level we find regional embeddedness to be important to the resistance of manufacturing and financial and business services and sectoral embeddedness to matter more for the resistance of construction and wholesale, retail \& IT. Our findings highlight nuances that policymakers should be aware of in planning for resilience.},

The population-dependent scaling of operating revenue, work space, and number of employees was investigated for almost 3000 arts organizations in the US, both in aggregate and by arts discipline (music, theater, visual and design arts, dance, and museums). Unlike general measures of creativity, the three measures of economic footprint did not scale supra-linearly with the population of metropolitan areas. Rather, operating revenue scaled linearly (e.g., like amenities), and work space and employee number scaled sub-linearly (e.g., like infrastructure). The cost of living, proxied by housing costs, increased with MSA population, though not as rapidly as did arts organization operating revenue, indicating a degree of uncoupling. The generally higher educational attainment of adults in larger cities, coupled with the growth of the education-dependent arts patronage, suggest a funding focus on less populous (50,000\&ndash;1,000,000), as well as on under-performing, cities.},

Here we show -- employing CoastalDEM---that 190\,M people (150--250\,M, 90\% CI) currently occupy global land below projected high tide lines for 2100 under low carbon emissions, up from 110\,M today, for a median increase of 80\,M. These figures triple SRTM-based values. Under high emissions, CoastalDEM indicates up to 630\,M people live on land below projected annual flood levels for 2100, and up to 340\,M for mid-century, versus roughly 250\,M at present. We estimate one billion people now occupy land less than 10\,m above current high tide lines, including 230\,M below 1\,m.},

  abstract = {The article concentrates on big cities in western societies and the changing principles of urban development since the twentieth century. It combines general principles and the dual cycle theory of urban expansion and urban renewal with the impact of political systems and cultural environments. Three general principles are formative for the internal structure of cities: 1. The accessibility determined by transport technology. 2. The so-called `distance-decay' from center to periphery, defined by the social gradient and the land values gradient. 3. The hierarchical organization of urban space. The dual cycle theory of urban development, explains urban decay as a consequence of the time lag between urban expansion and urban renewal. Development differs greatly depending on whether it takes place under private capitalism, in welfare states, or in postsocialist countries. Three periods of urban development are distinguished. After World War II the system of centered cities dating from the period of Europeanization of the globe, was superseded by city models derived from North America. During the period AD 1950--2000, a rapidly growing system of suburbia created a sort of extensive -- though not ubiquitous -- network. The combination of `urban-like,' suburban structures and new megastructures seems to correspond to postindustrial America's abandonment of the areas of earlier industrial-city development. In the foreseeable future, however, twenty-first century city development is unlikely to follow North American models much longer. All over the globe -- in the geo-strategically and economically newly relevant BRIC (Brazil, Russia, India, and China) countries as well as in all countries of the Islamic world -- decision makers have recognized that the inherent functioning of cities (above all of metropolises and capital cities) with the help of state-of-the-art technologies, has gained in importance. Megacities in these regions with populations of 20 million and more surpass all European and North American big cities.},

Using a unique dataset gathering spatially explicit data on rents, population densities, housing sizes, and transport times in neighborhoods inside 192 cities on all continents, we investigate on a systematic basis the empirical relevance of the key stylized facts predicted by this model. Some of these predictions appear extremely robust: cities are more spread out when they are richer, more populated, and when transportation or agricultural land is less costly, and 95\% of the cities of our sample exhibit the predicted negative density gradient from the city center to suburbs. Rent variations inside cities are also significantly explained by transport times in most of the cities (159 cities). However, housing production (and population densities) seem significantly impacted by rents in only slightly more than half of the cities (106 cities). Nevertheless, high levels of informality, strong regulations and planning, specific amenities (e.g. coastal amenities) are, as expected by the theory, main factors leading to the discrepancies. Overall, several decades after its creation, the standard urban model seems to still capture surprisingly well the inner structure of many cities across the world, both in developed and in developing countries.},

  abstract = {Purpose -- This paper aims to pose an important starting point for the application of the search-and-matching models to real estate appraisals, thus reducing the ``gap'' between practitioners and academicians. Due to relevant trading frictions, the search-and-matching framework has become the benchmark theoretical model of the housing market. Starting from the large related literature, this paper develops a simplified approach to modelling the frictions that focuses on the direct relationship between house price and market tightness (a common feature only for the labour market matching models). The characterization of the equilibrium through two main variables simplifies the analysis and allows using the theoretical model for empirical purposes, namely, the real estate appraisals. Design/methodology/approach -- This work is both theoretical and empirical. Theoretically, a long-run equilibrium model with a positive share of vacant houses and home seekers is determined along with price and market tightness. Also, the conditions of existence and uniqueness of the steady-state equilibrium are determined. Unlike most of the search-and-matching models in the housing literature, the out-of-the steady-state dynamics are also analyzed to show the stability of the equilibrium. Empirically, to show the usefulness of the theoretical model, a numerical simulation is performed. By using two readily available housing market data -- the expected time on the market and the average number of trades -- it is possible to determine the key variables of the model: price, market tightness and matching opportunities for both buyers and sellers. Although the numerical simulation concerns the Italian housing market, the proposed model is generally valid, being empirically applicable to all real estate markets characterized by non-negligible trading frictions. Indeed, the proposed model can be used to compare housing markets with different features (concerning the search and matching process), as well as analyse the same housing market in different time periods (because the efficiency of the search and matching process can change). Findings -- Several important results are obtained. First, the price adjustment -- i.e. the difference between the actual selling price and the price obtained in an ideal situation of frictionless housing market -- is remarkable. This means that the sign and the size of the price adjustment depend on the extent of trading frictions in the housing market. Precisely, the higher the trading frictions on the demand side (more buyers and less sellers), the higher the actual selling price (the price adjustment is positive), whereas the higher the trading frictions on the supply side (less buyers and more sellers), the lower the actual selling price (the price adjustment is negative). Accordingly, the real estate appraisers should assess the trading frictions in the housing market before determining the price adjustment. Second, an increase in the number of trades affects the house price only if the time on the market varies. Also, the higher the variation in the time on the market, the larger the house price adjustment. Indeed, the expected time on the market reflects the opportunities to matching for both parties and thus the trading frictions. If the time on the market increases (decreases), the seller will receive less (more) opportunities to match; thus, the actual selling price will be driven downwards (upwards). Originality/value -- As far as the authors are aware, none of the existing works in the search and matching literature has considered how to take advantage of this theoretical approach to estimate the house price in the presence of trading frictions in the housing market. Indeed, the proposed theoretical model may be a useful tool for real estate appraisers, as it is able to derive the trading frictions from the time on the market and the number of trades, thus estimating properly the house price.},

  abstract = {Purpose This paper aims to study the relationship between the rental and selling prices, a very important topic that forms the fundamentals of real estate markets. Design/methodology/approach This theoretical paper makes use of a search and matching model of the housing market. The search and matching models are the benchmark models of the ``matching'' markets, such as the labour market and the housing market, where trade is a decentralised, uncoordinated and time-consuming economic activity. Findings Unlike the previous related literature, where this relation is usually analysed in the context of the present value equation, this paper shows the existence of a ``dual'' relation between rental and selling prices as follows: one in the homeownership market and another one in the rental market. This ``dual'' relation connects the rental and homeownership markets and allows to get equilibrium in both markets with positive house prices. Research limitations/implications Several topics could be deepened for making the paper richer and more interesting, although at the cost of much more mathematics. First of all, the introduction of specific functional forms for both the rent function and the sale price function, so as to calculate both the elasticity of rent with respect to sale price and the elasticity of sale price with respect to rent. In this way, it would be possible to understand how each market (rental and homeownership) reacts to shock and policies that affect the other market. Practical implications In general, this framework could help policymakers to design housing policy reforms that take into consideration the effects on both markets. Indeed, some policies could have positive effects on rental markets but perverse effects on homeownership markets and vice versa. Originality/value None of the existing and related works of research have considered how to take advantage of the search and matching approach to derive both a ``rent function'' and a ``sale price function'' that connect closely the rental and homeownership markets.},

  abstract = {Urban development relies heavily on labour, while the change in urban housing prices, in turn, has a crucial impact on labour. Therefore, the regulatory policies of housing prices have become a critical content of urban management worldwide for a long time. Based on the theoretical analysis of urban housing prices and labour mobility, we use fixed-effect panel model with the panel data of 281 cities in China from 2002 to 2018. We study the impact of rising urban housing prices on labour and identify the housing price jump as an instrumental variable in solving the endogenous problem. The results are as follows. First, the increase in urban housing prices has a crowding-out effect on labour mobility. Second, there is a moderating effect on different levels of education, urban construction, and income under the impact of urban housing prices on labour mobility. Third, the heterogeneity of the impact is reflected in the housing price-to-income ratios and industrial structures. These conclusions are supposed to have significant enlightenment for controlling the urban housing prices during high-quality economic growth and guiding labour flow more rationally.}

  abstract = {The factors that account for the differences in the economic productivity of urban areas have remained difficult to measure and identify unambiguously. Here we show that a microscopic derivation of urban scaling relations for economic quantities vs. population, obtained from the consideration of social and infrastructural properties common to all cities, implies an effective model of economic output in the form of a Cobb-Douglas type production function. As a result we derive a new expression for the Total Factor Productivity (TFP) of urban areas, which is the standard measure of economic productivity per unit of aggregate production factors (labor and capital). Using these results we empirically demonstrate that there is a systematic dependence of urban productivity on city population size, resulting from the mismatch between the size dependence of wages and labor, so that in contemporary US cities productivity increases by about 11\% with each doubling of their population. Moreover, deviations from the average scale dependence of economic output, capturing the effect of local factors, including history and other local contingencies, also manifest surprising regularities. Although, productivity is maximized by the combination of high wages and low labor input, high productivity cities show invariably high wages and high levels of employment relative to their size expectation. Conversely, low productivity cities show both low wages and employment. These results shed new light on the microscopic processes that underlie urban economic productivity, explain the emergence of effective aggregate urban economic output models in terms of labor and capital inputs and may inform the development of economic theory related to growth.},

Here, we develop a large-scale study to test explicitly the relative importance of urban population and Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth in affecting ULE for different regions, economic development levels and governance types for 300+ cities. Our results show that population growth, more than GDP, is consistently the dominant determinant of ULE during 1970--2014. However, the effect of GDP growth on ULE increases in importance after 2000. In countries with strong governance, economic growth contributes more to ULE than population growth. We find that urban population growth and ULE are correlated but this relationship varies for countries at different developmental stages. Lastly, this study illustrates that good governance is a necessary condition for economic growth to affect ULE.}

Somewhat similarly, Storper (2013) argues that recent divergence been fundamentally been driven by the fact that some cities have become more specialised in knowledge intensive sectors. While most of this interest in urban divergence has been based on US cities, recent European research also reports divergent processes. The aim of this article is to examine the degree of divergence across UK cities and to analyse how far this has been driven by differences among cities in industrial structure and specialisation, tradable bases and productivity.},

We analyze the wage dynamics of migrants from lower to higher density areas in Italy, using quantile regressions and individual data. The results show that unskilled workers benefit more from a wage premium accruing over time, while skilled workers enjoy a wage premium when they migrate as well as a wage increase over time. Further, we find that for unskilled workers the wage growth over time is mainly due to human capital accumulation in line with the ``learning'' hypothesis, while for skilled workers the wage growth is mainly explained by the ``coordination'' hypothesis, i.e., cities enhance the probability of better matches between workers and firms.},

To estimate the STJM model for large datasets, we consider the Integrated Nested Laplace Approximation (INLA) methodology. We apply the STJM to predict the time to full prepayment on a large dataset of 57,258 US mortgage borrowers with more than 2.5 million observations. Empirical results indicate that including spatial effects consistently improves the performance of the joint model. However, the gains are less definitive when we additionally include spatio-temporal interactions.}

The extant literature proposes different measures and definitions, without achieving a unitary view of the concept. In this paper, an interpretation of regional resilience thorough Sen's capability approach is proposed. In particular, resilience emerges as a collective capability, and ``being resilient'' as a collective functioning. Individual characteristics of the agents operating in a region and the interaction between them lead to this interpretation. The definitions and measures adopted by the extant literature appear to be parts of a whole, which is difficult to capture in a single analysis.},

Greater export orientation reduces such concentration. Finally, GDP per capita, population, and export orientation reduce primacy. Political factors, such as whether a country's largest city is also its capital, affect primacy. Our results do not seem to imply that developing-country urbanization today differs fundamentally from urbanization in the past.}

I then calibrate the model to the Paris urban area and use counterfactual simulations to study the effects of a) the Regional Express Rail and b) restricting car use in the city center. I find that on top of having a strong contribution to suburbanization and reducing welfare inequalities, the public transport network reduced income segregation in the area. Turning to the prospective effects of banning cars in the city center, the model predicts a reduction of the income disparities between Paris and its suburbs, at the cost of a substantial welfare loss.},

Perhaps more important, it is how individuals' `local knowledge' create place-making within their locality.

We use a quasi-experimental design and Swedish administrative data to document that the average heir depletes her inheritance within a decade while the inheritances of wealthy heirs remain intact. These different depletion rates are not due to different consumption or labour supply responses but due to different rates of return on inherited wealth. Upon their receipt, inheritances reduce relative measures of wealth inequality, such as top shares or percentile ratios. Theoretically, this reduction in inequality could be due to either a compressed inheritance distribution or similar chances of having wealthy parents (high intergenerational mobility). Empirically, the first force is more significant in Sweden. Within a decade, however, the effect is reversed: inheritances increase wealth inequality since the different depletion rates widen the inequality in inherited wealth over time. This implies that inheritance taxation can reduce long run wealth inequality only through the taxation of wealthy heirs.},

  abstract = {America's remarkable explosion of industrial output and national wealth at the end of the nineteenth century was matched by a troubling rise in poverty and worker unrest. As politicians and intellectuals fought over the causes of this crisis, Henry George (1839-1897) published a radical critique of laissez-faire capitalism and its threat to the nation's republican traditions.{$<$}em{$>$}Progress and Poverty{$<$}/em{$>$}(1879), which became a surprise best-seller, offered a provocative solution for preserving these traditions while preventing the amassing of wealth in the hands of the few: a single tax on land values. George's writings and years of social activism almost won him the mayor's seat in New York City in 1886. Though he lost the election, his ideas proved instrumental to shaping a popular progressivism that remains essential to tackling inequality today.  Edward T. O'Donnell's exploration of George's life and times merges labor, ethnic, intellectual, and political history to illuminate the early militant labor movement in New York during the Gilded Age. He locates in George's rise to prominence the beginning of a larger effort by American workers to regain control of the workplace and obtain economic security and opportunity. The Gilded Age was the first but by no means the last era in which Americans confronted the mixed outcomes of modern capitalism. George's accessible, forward-thinking ideas on democracy, equality, and freedom have tremendous value for contemporary debates over the future of unions, corporate power, Wall Street recklessness, government regulation, and political polarization today.},

  abstract = {This chapter presents a "conceptual design pattern" (CDP) that represents key elements of standard ABM/LUCC models in a comprehensive logical framework and includes basic functionality and data often present in ABM/LUCC models. The CDP illustrates the key building blocks for ABM/LUCC models, creating a template to assist scholars new to the field to understand existing models and design their own models. Second, the framework facilitates direct comparison of the structure and function of existing models. We present five separately developed models within this framework (SLUDGE, SOME, FEARLUS, LUCITA, and SYPRIA), demonstrating how multiple models can be represented and compared within the same meta-structure. The exercise highlights elements common to all models, demonstrates the unique contributions of each model, reveals commonalities between models, and highlights processes associated with land-use change that are not covered by our models. The CDP as presented here is very much a work in progress, and we welcome feedback from other ABM/LUCC developers, in the hopes of ultimately developing a shared model representation that will accelerate the development of not only ABM/LUCC, but also the theory of land-use change.},

  abstract = {This article presents an overview of multi-agent system models of land-use/cover change (MAS/LUCC models). This special class of LUCC models combines a cellular landscape model with agent-based representations of decision making, integrating the two components through specification of interdependencies and feedbacks between agents and their environment. The authors review alternative LUCC modeling techniques and discuss the ways in which MAS/LUCC models may overcome some important limitations of existing techniques. We briefly review ongoing MAS/LUCC modeling efforts in four research areas. We discuss the potential strengths of MAS/LUCC models and suggest that these strengths guide researchers in assessing the appropriate choice of model for their particular research question. We find that MAS/LUCC models are particularly well suited for representing complex spatial interactions under heterogeneous conditions and for modeling decentralized, autonomous decision making. We discuss a range of possible roles for MAS/LUCC models, from abstract models designed to derive stylized hypotheses to empirically detailed simulation models appropriate for scenario and policy analysis. We also discuss the challenge of validation and verification for MAS/LUCC models. Finally, we outline important challenges and open research questions in this new field. We conclude that, while significant challenges exist, these models offer a promising new tool for researchers whose goal is to create fine-scale models of LUCC phenomena that focus on human-environment interactions.},

Again, with the emergence of computer simulation technologies it became possible for economists to formally model the evolutionary change inherent in the theories of these great thinkers.5}

This paper reviews recent quantitative urban models, which incorporate both differences in natural advantages and agglomeration forces, and can be taken directly to observed data on cities. We show that these models can be used to estimate the strength of agglomeration forces and evaluate the impact of transportation infrastructure improvements on welfare and the spatial distribution of economic activity.},

We introduce a new methodology for discriminating between the three leading explanations for this suburbanization (workplace attractiveness, residence attractiveness and bilateral commuting frictions). This methodology holds in the class of spatial models that are characterized by a structural gravity equation for commuting. We show that the increased openness of counties to commuting is mainly explained by reductions in bilateral commuting frictions, consistent with the expansion of the interstate highway network and the falling real cost of car ownership. We find that changes in workplace attractiveness and residence attractiveness are more important in explaining the observed shift in employment by workplace and employment by residence towards lower densities over time.},

If such a theory is feasible, then its formulation must be in a mathematical way. As a contribution to organizing the mathematical ideas that deal with such a systematic way of understanding urban phenomena, we present this material, concentrating on one important aspect of what recently has been called the new science of cities. In this paper, we review the main mathematical models present in the literature that aim at explaining the origin and emergence of urban scaling. We intend to present the models, identify similarities and connections between them, and find situations in which different models lead to the same output. In addition, we report situations in which some ideas initially introduced in a particular model can also be introduced in another model, generating more diversification and increasing the scope of the models. The models treated in this paper explain urban scaling from different premises: from gravity ideas, passing through densification ideas and cites' geometry, to a hierarchical organization and socio-network properties. We also investigate scenarios in which these different fundamental ideas could be interpreted as similar -- where the similarity is likely but not obvious. Furthermore, in what concerns the gravity idea, we propose a general framework that includes all gravity models analyzed as a particular case.},

Recently, the literature has also begun to provide evidence on the microfoundations of external economies of scale. The best known of these sources are those attributed to Marshall (1920): labor market pooling, input sharing, and knowledge spillovers. Evidence to date supports the presence of all three of these forces. In addition, there is also evidence that natural advantage, home market effects, consumption opportunities, and rent-seeking all contribute to agglomeration.},

This study tests this hypothesis for the case of Colombia. We ask whether knowledge externalities lead to growth in economic complexity. If yes, which variety of knowledge externalities---Marshall-Arrow-Romer (MAR), Porter or Jacobs? Results from our empirical investigation uphold the MAR theories of externalities or intra-industrial externalities, which are maximized with high local specialization1 and local monopoly. A pattern of convergence in economic complexity of Colombian municipalities emerges from our results, supporting Schumpeterian growth theories, which advocate that knowledge externalities drive convergence. This is in line with the recent macroeconomic trends of the Colombian economy, which is suffering from ``Dutch disease'' leading to a contraction in its domestic economy. We show that knowledge externalities are a mechanism through which convergence dynamics are brought about and fostered in the domestic economy.},

  abstract = {Implicit discount rates (IDRs) are employed in energy models to capture household investment decisions, yet the factors behind the IDR and their respective implications for policy-making usually remain blurred and fractional. The proposed comprehensive framework distinguishes three broad categories of factors underlying the IDR for household adoption of energy-efficient technologies (EETs): preferences (notably over time, risk, loss, debt, and the environment), predictable (ir)rational behavior (bounded rationality, rational inattention, behavioral biases), and external barriers to energy efficiency. Existing empirical findings suggest that the factors underlying the IDRs that differ across household characteristics and technologies should be accounted for in energy models. Furthermore, the framework allows for a fresh look at the interplay of IDRs and policies. We argue that a simple observation of high IDRs (or observing correlations between IDRs and socio-economic characteristics) does not provide guidance for policy-making since the underlying sources cannot be identified. Instead, we propose that some of the factors underlying the IDR - notably external barriers - can be changed (through directed policy interventions) whereas other factors - notably preferences and predictable (ir)rational behavior - are innate and can only be taken into account (through reactive policy interventions).},

  abstract = {A key driver of urbanization is the pursuit of economic opportunities in cities. One such opportunity is the promise of higher wages in larger cities, a phenomenon known as the urban wage premium. While an urban wage premium has been well-documented among U.S. metropolitan areas, little is known about its existence in micropolitan areas, which represent an important link between rural and dense urban areas. Here we measure the power law scaling coefficient of annual wages versus employment for both U.S. metropolitan and micropolitan areas over a 37-year period. We take this coefficient to be a quantification of the urban wage premium for each type of urban area and find the relationship is superlinear in all years for both area types. Though both area types once had wage premiums of similar magnitude, the wage premium in micropolitan areas has steadily declined since the late 1980s while in metropolitan areas it has generally increased. This growing gap between micropolitan and metropolitan wage premiums is ongoing in parallel to other diverging characteristics, such as inequality and voting behavior, suggesting that our result is part of a broader social, cultural, and political divergence between small and large cities. Finally, we speculate that if urban residents respond to the COVID-19 crisis by migrating, the trends we describe may change significantly.},

Urban scaling laws are empirically observed power-law relationships between population (i.e., city size) and other characteristics of cities in the same country. The theoretical underpinnings of these relationships have been proposed in The Origins of Scaling in Cities model, which derives scaling exponents from fundamental concepts in economic geography and general first principles of physics. The model introduces a parameter called net urban benefit, defined as a city's social output minus the dissipative costs of infrastructure, representing a new metric relevant to city sustainability. Here we present a new derivation for a functional form of the metric, as well as new derivations that reveal how cities behave when the metric is maximized. We show results for U.S. cities and discuss the implications for the sustainability of the U.S. urban system, including the feedback mechanisms that keep cities on their current trajectories toward maximizing their socioeconomic output while minimizing infrastructure costs.},

Locations are equally distributed over a circular space. We find that the multiplicity of stable spatial equilibria is the rule and not the exception. Using the concept of stability areas to study the transition from one stable equilibrium to the next, we show that decreasing commuting or transportation costs generate equilibrium paths that may feature a megalopolis or hierarchical system of cities having different sizes. We confirm that transportation and commuting costs have opposite impacts on the space-economy.},

We distinguish between classical-Marxian and post-Keynesian models, and analyze them under three different assumptions on the determinants of technical change: capital accumulation, income distribution, and labor market tightness. The balanced growth implications of alternative models are compared with neoclassical exogenous and endogenous growth theories. Despite the strong differences in the assumptions regarding the substitutability between capital and labor, the role of different classes in society, and whether or not productive factors are fully employed, the various alternative models can be classified in a way that highlights remarkable similarities with their neoclassical counterparts. Both neoclassical and alternative theories of endogenous growth: (i) have shown that long-run growth is sensitive to investment decisions, and (ii) rely on a linear spillover from the stock of knowledge to the production of innovations. The comparison highlights the different channels emphasized by competing theories: saving behavior and market structure in the neoclassical theories, as opposed to income distribution, the state of the labor market, and investors' behavior in alternative theories.},

Many of the distinctive theoretical implications of learning by doing have been derived under the assumption that the cost--quantity relationships observed in numerous empirical studies are largely the result of passive learning and some further require that passive learning is unbounded. The empirical literature raises doubts about both assumptions. When observed cost--quantity relationships indicate sustained productivity growth, factors other than passive learning are generally at work. When passive learning is the dominant factor, productivity growth is invariably bounded. Thus, empirically relevant theories incorporating learning by doing are hybrid models in which passive learning coexists with other sources of growth. But in such models, many of the distinctive implications of passive learning become unimportant. Moreover, passive learning is often an inessential component of long-run growth; to the contrary, too much learning can lead to stagnation.},

This shift has had both strategicand normative components and has reduced the bargainingpower of labor and the centrality ofproduction.

US multinationals shift twice as much profit as other multinationals relative to the size of their foreign earnings. We analyse how the location of corporate profits would change if shifted profits were reallocated to their source countries. Domestic profits would increase by about 20\${\textbackslash}\%\$ in high-tax European Union countries, 10\${\textbackslash}\%\$ in the US, and 5\${\textbackslash}\%\$ in developing countries, while they would fall by 55\${\textbackslash}\%\$ in tax havens. We provide a new international database of GDP, trade balances, and factor shares corrected for profit shifting. In contrast to the picture painted by official statistics, our results suggest that the corporate capital share has increased not only in North America but also in high-tax European countries. Capital is making a comeback globally, but its rise is obscured by the tax avoidance strategies of multinational companies.},

Solow published "A Contribution to the Theory of Economic Growth" in the February issue of the QJE in 1956, and Trevor Swan published "Economic Growth and Capital Accumulation" in the Economic Record, subsequent to Solow in December 1956.

Using exogenous variation arising from a novel instrument - courier's stations during the Ming dynasty, we find solid evidence that the opening of a HSR station increases cities' innovation activity. We also explore the role of inter-city technology diffusion as being behind the surge of local innovation. To do it, we compute least-cost paths between city-pairs, over time, based on the opening and speed of each HSR line, and obtain that an increase in a city's connectivity to other cities specialized in a specific technological field, through the HSR network, increases the probability for the city to specialize in that same technological field. We interpret it as evidence of knowledge diffusion.},

The diversification thesis argues that knowledge spills over between different industries, causing diversified production structures to be more innovative. A closely related debate evolves around local competitiveness hypotheses. Using an original database of innovation counts, both these issues are addressed for the Dutch context. The results show that the Marshallian specialization thesis holds, though more pronounced for R\&D intensive and small firms. Fierce local competition within an industry negatively affects innovativeness in that particular industry.},

To overcome this problem, a wide variety of external instruments has been applied in the literature. However, the use of instruments may lead to wrong inference if they are either weak, or endogenous to the system being estimated. In this paper, we extend the widely used Feenstra (1994) estimator, which does not depend on external instruments, to make it applicable to the problem of estimating the elasticity of substitution between capital and labour. We propose a pooled GMM (PGMM) estimator, examine its properties in a Monte Carlo study and apply it to a Norwegian sample of manufacturing firms. We identify the conditions under which P-GMM yields unbiased estimates and compare it to a fixed effects estimator which is unbiased when factor prices are exogenous - a typical assumption in the literature. We find that the fixed effects estimator is heavily downward biased in the presence of simultaneity. In contrast, the P-GMM estimator is nearly unbiased provided the number of time periods (T) is not too small (say, more than 10). In our application, with an unbalanced sample and T = 12, we estimate the elasticity of substitution to be 1.8 using P-GMM and 1.0 using a fixed effects estimator. Hence, neglecting simultaneity may lead to the conclusion that capital and labour are complements when, in fact, they are substitutes.},

The Irish government created the National Assets Administration (NAMA) to purchase bad real estate loans from banks to solve credit problems. In 2013, Ireland introduced the REIT law. The establishment of REIT brought sustainable activities to the real estate market. REIT has attracted many investors and reintroduced working capital to the construction industry. In 2020, COVID-19 began to spread in Ireland. The epidemic greatly limited the development of some real estate and the operation strategy of REIT. This article draws a conclusion through the qualitative analysis of REIT. REIT plays an important role in the recovery of Irish real estate market economy. At the same time, it also has a great impact on Irish real estate market. However, REIT has been established for a long time, so it is impossible to quantify its future performance with existing data.},

We offer a critical urban political economy perspective and a particular set of arguments run through the review: first, land is not the same as capital but has unique attributes as a factor of production which require a separate theorisation. Second, since the 1970s consensus around land rent and the city dissipated, the critical literature has tended to take the question of why/how the payment exists at all for granted and so has ignored the particular dynamics of rent arising from the idiosyncrasies of land. Amongst the talk of an `Anthropocene' and `planetary urbanisation' it is surprising that the economic fulcrum of the capitalist remaking of geography has fallen so completely off the agenda. It is time to bring rent back into the analysis of land, cities and capitalism.},

  abstract = {"This is science writing as wonder and as inspiration."~---The Wall Street JournalWall Street JournalFrom one of the most influential scientists of our time, a dazzling exploration of the hidden laws that govern the life cycle of everything from plants and animals to the cities we live in.Visionary physicist Geoffrey West is a pioneer in the field of complexity science, the science of emergent systems and networks. The term ``complexity'' can be misleading, however, because what makes West's discoveries so beautiful is that he has found an underlying simplicity that unites the seemingly complex and diverse phenomena of living systems, including our bodies, our cities and our businesses. Fascinated by aging and mortality, West applied the rigor of a physicist to the biological question of why we live as long as we do and no longer. The result was astonishing, and changed science: West found that despite the riotous diversity in mammals, they are all, to a large degree, scaled versions of each other. If you know the size of a mammal, you can use scaling laws to learn everything from how much food it eats per day, what its heart-rate is, how long it will take to mature, its lifespan, and so on. Furthermore, the efficiency of the mammal's circulatory systems scales up precisely based on weight: if you compare a mouse, a human and an elephant on a logarithmic graph, you find with every doubling of average weight, a species gets 25\% more efficient---and lives 25\% longer. Fundamentally, he has proven, the issue has to do with the fractal geometry of the networks that supply energy and remove waste from the organism's body.  West's work has been game-changing for biologists, but then he made the even bolder move of exploring his work's applicability. Cities, too, are constellations of networks and laws of scalability relate with eerie precision to them. Recently, West has applied his revolutionary work to the business world. This investigation has led to powerful insights into why some companies thrive while others fail. The implications of these discoveries are far-reaching, and are just beginning to be explored. Scale is a thrilling scientific adventure story about the elemental natural laws that bind us together in simple but profound ways. Through the brilliant mind of Geoffrey West, we can envision how cities, companies and biological life alike are dancing to the same simple, powerful tune.},

Households move when a stochastic process leaves them dissatisfied with their current unit. Household buyers expend costly search effort to find a better house, while sellers hold two units until a buyer is found. The vacancy rate, fixed in the short run, determines the expected length of sale and search, which play a central role in the reservation prices of buyer and seller. Market prices, the result of bargaining, lie between these two. The model yields a strong theoretical relationship (inverse) between vacancy and prices, which with competitive supply explains the existence of longer-run "structural" vacancy.},

The second is Vonovia, Germany's largest real estate company, originally a subsidiary of a British private equity firm. Both examples embody what we call the shift from financialisation 1.0 to financialisation 2.0, i.e. the transition from pure speculation to long-term investment. We show that long-term investment strategies are used by REITs and listed funds in order to release housing into the privatised mainstream of capital accumulation. With the advent of the financialisation of rental housing 2.0, the long-term investment focus of these funds paradoxically enables a short-term investment focus by buying and selling shares in these funds on the stock exchange},

Sometimes this is just a question of how the word class is being used, but behind the alternative uses of the term there often lurks deeper theoretical disagreements about how best to understand the nature and consequences of economic inequality in contemporary societies. This seminar will explore in a systematic and rigorous manner the full range of alternative conceptualizations of class. The focus will be on contemporary approaches, although there will be some attention to classic statements. The course will give students an opportunity both to gain a deeper understanding of the substantive issues around the analysis of class, but also to engage in a very fine-grained manner the problem of carefully defining concepts. Sociologists often take a quite casual attitude towards the problem of concept-formation. While they may worry quite a bit about the theoretical arguments that link concepts together, much less attention is frequently paid to the underlying logic of the abstract definitions of the concepts themselves.}

  abstract = {Urban scaling laws describe powerful universalities of the scaling relationships between urban attributes and the city size across different countries and times. There are still challenges in precise statistical estimation of the scaling exponent; the properties of variance require further study. In this paper, a statistical regression method based on the maximum likelihood estimation considering the lower bound constraints and the heterogeneous variance of error structure, termed as CHVR, is proposed for urban scaling estimation. In the CHVR method, the heterogeneous properties of variance are explored and modeled in the form of a power-of-the-mean variance model. The maximum likelihood fitting method is supplemented to satisfy the lower bound constraints in empirical data. The CHVR method has been applied to estimating the scaling exponents of six urban attributes covering three scaling regimes in China and compared with two traditional methods. Method evaluations based on three different criteria validate that compared with both classical methods, the CHVR method is more effective and robust. Moreover, a statistical test and long-term variations of the parameter in the variance function demonstrate that the proposed heterogeneous variance function can not only describe the heterogeneity in empirical data adequately but also provide more meaningful urban information. Therefore, the CHVR method shows great potential to provide a valuable tool for effective urban scaling studies across the world and be applied to scaling law estimation in other complex systems in the future.},

The spatial considerations allow households to sort into segmented housing markets based on income. Our model generates the observed negative relationship between housing expenditure share and income. More importantly, the cap policy causes a more considerable reduction in housing costs for low-income families than for high-income families in a spatial model. Depending on the assumption of households' preference, this mechanism leads to a minor increase or even a modest decrease in welfare inequality in a spatial model than in a spaceless model.}

This research examines consumers' sensitivity to the prospective duration relevant to their decisions and the implications of such sensitivity for intertemporal trade-offs, especially the degree of present bias (i.e., hyperbolic discounting). The authors show that participants' subjective perceptions of prospective duration are not sufficiently sensitive to changes in objective duration and are nonlinear and concave in objective time, consistent with psychophysical principles. More important, this lack of sensitivity can explain hyperbolic discounting. The results replicate standard hyperbolic discounting effects with respect to objective time but show a relatively constant rate of discounting with respect to subjective time perceptions. The results are replicated between subjects (Experiment 1) and within subjects (Experiments 2), with multiple time horizons and multiple descriptors, and with different measurement orders. Furthermore, the authors show that when duration is primed, subjective time perception is altered (Experiment 4) and hyperbolic discounting is reduced (Experiment 3).}
