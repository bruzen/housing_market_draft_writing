ANALYSIS SECTION - PRODUCTIVITY AND SERVICING - DENSITY RELATIONSHIPS For example, two stylized facts should be noticed. The first is that the marginal cost of servicing generally rises with the distance from the centre. Figure illustrates the general form of servicing costs, but not the relative scales of rent and servicing costs. When this observation is combined with the \gls{Henry George Theorem} the conclusion is that the optimal size of the city  is at  $d^{**}$, where marginal service cost intersects with the marginal increase in total urban rent.  Walter Christaller, 1933

ANALYSIS SECTION - PRODUCTIVITY AND TAX - The second stylized fact is that property taxes, which are generally  fixed as a share of property value, decline as the distance from the centre increases. Figure~\ref{fig-municipal-costs} illustrates the general form of tax liabilities, although it does not  accurately represent their relationship to rent or  servicing costs. This implies that in many or most urban situations the residents at the outer edges pay less than the average amount in property tax per unit of land, but cost  the community budget more than the average amount. In essence, the central city subsidizes the suburbs. (see Perverse Cities \ref{blaisPerverseCitiesHidden2011}). This arrangement is both economically inefficient and unfair, but it has been built into the fiscal structure of cities largely as a result of automobile-based urban growth. It is likely that this fiscal misallocation saps some of the potential productivity growth of cities. Property taxation reduces the market value of properties, but it also funds services and amenities that increase the value of properties. 

Both servicing and taxation effects are more variable and than the simple model suggests.  One conclusion urban theorists draw based on variants of the Alonso model is that because property owners in the low-density urban margin are subsidized,  the subsidy is likely to create serious fiscal problems for municipalities in the long-term and result in serious inefficiency in land use.

Political opposition is essentially rent seeking.



\chapter{TODO}

The model with begins a simple observation - that people are more productive in cities. This is an observation that was explored by Sir William Arthur Lewis (1915 -- 1991)  \emph{Economic Development with Unlimited Supplies of Labour} described a model 
\cite{Lewis1954EconomicDW}. Lewis received the Nobel Prize in Economics in 1979, (sharing it with Theodore Schultz) for ``pioneering research into economic development research with particular consideration of the problems of developing countries." The observation implies that labour will move from the countryside to cities.  Graphically we could present the situation that Lewis analyzed as follows

This essay  is written in the classical tradition, making the classical assumption, and asking the classical question. The classics, from Smith to Marx,  all  assumed,  or argued, that an unlimited supply of labour was available at subsistence wages. They then enquired how production grows through time. They found the answer in capital accumulation, which they explained in terms of their analysis of the distribution of income. Classical systems thus determined simultaneously   income distribution and income growth, with the relative prices of commodities as a  minor bye-product.

The purpose of this essay is thus to see what  can be made of the classical  framework  in  solving  problems of distribution, accumulation, and growth, first in a closed and then in an open economy. 





According to  Lewis Cecil Gray, Rent Under the Assumption of Exhaustibility \cite{Gray1914RentUT}
``Ricardo modified the economic concept of land as the source of a rent payment, and introduced the assumption that rent is a payment for " the indestructible qualities of the soil.''

 In this sense the basis of rent may be indestructible. The clearest illustration is urban land.
``The entire return attributable to land is a surplus which accrues so long as the conditions of demand and supply remain unchanged.''

This study is an exploration of the impact of financialization of the housing market, and what that means for urban productivity.

This matters because, % thinking about housing markets and what was going on in Ontario, and around the world,
cities are going through a great transformation of ownership structures.

- theire dynamics static tools are not enough. 

"Urbanization and growth go together: no country has ever reached middle income status without a significant population shift into cities." \cite{annezUrbanizationGrowthSetting2009} % (see book in \cite{spenceUrbanizationGrowth2009})

\subsection{Cities produce benefit and are central to productivity}
Cities produce enormous benefits and are central to productivity, they're also undergoing a massive change

the ownership tenure pumps wealth out'
however rich they get people are pushed to a kind of subsistence frontier. 
suggests also simple approaches to building of social wealth anchored in place.---clear suggestions for productive interventions- clear policy implications. 
%Most of the economic theory talks about where people go, and it doesn't talk about the value they create in the city and where that goes. That's finacialization, capturing those benefits is what capitalists are doing now.

What does this mean - given the particular structure of urban wealth creation.

Who claims those benefits, and what does that mean for productivity and the future of cities?

Our analysis suggests  it actually has  implications for the success of cities. % and of socieities, the future of a middle class, and whether citiec can continue to generate value. 


Cities are essential - draw on bettencourt/west's case,
Geoffrey West has argued that ``Cities are the crucible of civilization, the hubs of innovation, the engines of wealth creation and centers of power, the magnets that attract creative individuals, and the stimulant for ideas, growth, and innovation.'' \cite{westScaleUniversalLaws2017} 
Jane Jacobs talks about the vibrancy of cities, and their central role as the source of productivity. 
 \cite{jacobsEconomyCities1969}.
 
 Cities are particularly central to productivity.
 The scaling of wealth in cities has strong theoretical and empirical support  \cite{bettencourtGrowthInnovationScaling2007, bettencourtOriginsScalingCities2013, dongUnderstandingMesoscopicScaling2020, loboUrbanScalingProduction2013} 


in particular they are key to productivity. Wealth scales superlinearly with density - every increase in productivity, more than increases the productivity of the place. 
The relationship goes back into prehistory, not tied to any approach to government or anything else, from smallest nomadic communities, to largest empires, city states, and modern metropolises.

they live forever - so unlike individuals, don't move, don't die, in the same location as in ancient cities. Tokyo grow back. 


part of the story is what benefits they create
the second is who gets it

Most of the economic theory talks about where people go, and it doesn't talk about the value they create in the city and where that goes. That's finacialization, capturing those benefits is what capitalists are doing now.

\subsection{Cities are undergoing a massive change in ownership structure}
% There's price changes, but there's this deeper story of the transformation of the ownership structures. 
 % I realized that this idea of financialization of the housing market that seemed to be gaining a certain amount of currency when I started to think about it had some

Cities matter and are central to productivity, but one of the big changes happening now is they are undergoing a massive change in ownership structure.

RESEARCH GAP

The second sub-model incorporates  productivity of cities. Geoffrey West has argued that ``Cities are the crucible of civilization, the hubs of innovation, the engines of wealth creation and centers of power, the magnets that attract creative individuals, and the stimulant for ideas, growth, and innovation.'' \cite{westScaleUniversalLaws2017} 


There is a housing crisis ADD FACTS ABOUT WHAT WE MEAN BY THAT.



WHAT WE GET TO IS A MODEL THAT AIMS TO BE AS SIMPLE AS THE Alonso MODEL, BUT LINKS THESE 3 BRANCHES OF THE STUDY OF THE ECONOMY AND SPACE TOGETHER

"The main goal of this research as been to add a financial system to the simple Alonso model in order to examine the impact of financial cycles on urban productivity and distribution. The \gls{agent-based model} we develop has three major components:

\subsection{What we need to do}
% That sounds more simple than it is because to 
to achieve that, we need actually to 

1. build a model housing market for a city. 

2. And we have to, therefore have an urban model. 

3. And we have to figure out what it is that's at stake in the financialization which turns out to be land rents. And that means the city has to bring together essentially classical land rent theory, modern urban theory and the economics and bidding processes in a housing market. THIS IS THE MAIN PIECE, DO WE  NEED ALL IN THIS LIST?

4. And then it has to keep track of some macro variables that are significant for policy.

\section{The financialization of housing markets}
% This thesis is thus a contribution to developing a modern urban theory of rent.

%The effects of financialization on cities and economies has not been fully accounted for because the tools of the different, relevant disciplines have not been adequately integrated. The current approaches to describing the financialization of housing and its effects predict / explain /account for the housing crisis and effects on home ownership and access to housing, but our work shows that there are broader effects that have not been accounted for / predicted. 
% This fuller picture is made possible by bringing together classical rent theory, neo-classical XX and urban theory to create/and using/along with a agent-based model that allows us to .... (What the modelling technique enables) 
%This work is important for understanding the current policy context. 

\section{Position in the literature}

% We further link the model of urban rents to emerging concerns about the financialization of the housing market. 

%*** (another sentence on why this is great) --The space-less quality of the study of finance leaves out xyz GET PHRASING- CAN'T SEE- INTEGRATION OF SPACE NEGLECT GROWTH FACTOR. 
% Integrating classical and neoclassical economic approaches with standard urban theory,  allows us to identify 
% ..we can build a more comprehensive model of financialization and its effects. This makes it possible to trace the spatial distribution of the rents.

% Rent is important is all these traditions, but has been neglected in modern theory. We argue that to formally understand the processes behind financialization and the housing crisis, what's needed is a modern theory of urban rent. This thesis is a contribution to the development of that theory. REDUNDANCY?

% The focus of this thesis is a topic that falls in the overlap between three academic  disciplines, Economics, Urban Geography, and Planning. % ***E mAYBE SUMMARIZE THE FOCUS OF EACH? While Economics traditionally focuses on... Urban Geography looks at ..... and Planning is the study of....

 % ***E DO YOU MEAN GEOGRAPHIC SPACE AND PEOPLE SOMEHOW? i FEEL LIKE YOU DON'T MEAN THIS? MAYBE MORE LIKE: The central shared concern between the three discipline it the role of geographic space in shaping WHAT? social and economic systems? human systems? society??


%This thesis relates to four major fields: classical rent theory, neoclassical production theory and growth theory, the scaling literature, and urban spatial models.

We use the concept of rent to frame our consideration of how wealth is distributed in society by looking at WHAT?? how surplus is distributed? how locational value and location OR WHAT?? affects surplus distribution?? I dont know but please summarize how rent is used in this thesis. 

% Nearly contemporaneous thinker, Johann Heinrich  von Th\"unen (1783-1850) developed a planning model to guide the location of economic activities for an urban-agricultural society.  A version of that model  was reinvented in urban geography by XXX. Alonso\footnote{We use a version of the well-established model of Alonso (1964), Muth (1969) and Mills (1967), and formalised by Wheaton (1974),} % ***E NEED MORE DETAIL HERE ABOUT Alonso"S MODEL, 

% We link the Alonso model with more recent work on growth theory starting with Robert Solo's XXX and with the endogenous growth models of Lucas () and draw on Jane Jacobs's insight that endogenous urban growth  is. now driving economic development. Jacobs's insight is empirically supported by recent work in the complexity literature on urban scaling by XXXX ()



% ***E NEED TO POSITION THIS WORK IN RELATION TO THE MARGINALIST ACCOUNT IN THIS SECTION BECAUSE IT IS ONE OF THE FEW THINGS YOU HAVE INTRODUCES. tHE URBAN MODELS YOU DESCRIBE HERE SHOULD BE FRAMED BY WHAT YOU ADD IN BACKGROUND ABOUT PLANNING/URBAN MODELS (AS PER MY SUGGESTION IN THAT SECTION) 
% ***E YOU ALSO NEED TO ADD A SUMMARIZING PARAGRAPH WHICH I CAN HELP WRITE WHEN THIS SECTION IS MORE FILLED OUT. MAYBE THIS:
% ***E ADD: By bringing these approaches into a coherent approach, we can better account for  WHAT... EXPLAIN THAT alone they don't give as complete a picture. This thesis show that certain things become clear when they are brought together that provide an better account of the current situation. Older economics models do not predict certain things that are currently happening. This is because they are based on out of date modes of production, fail to account for the importance of location value and the modelling tools available when they were developed required some simplification.   Updating the models for the changing times, using more complex modelling systems and incorporating space with the economic models allow us to create models and narratives that provide a more effective understanding of the situation as it stands today.

%To capture urban productivity,

% Productivity scales with density in cities, throughout history, this is a strikingly consistent result, stretching even into prehistory. And cities don't die, they are notoriously hard to move.
 %Geoffrey West has argued that ``Cities are the crucible of civilization, the hubs of innovation, the engines of wealth creation and centers of power, the magnets that attract creative individuals, and the stimulant for ideas, growth, and innovation.'' \cite{westScaleUniversalLaws2017} CHECK SOURCE.

%Most of the economic theory talks about where people go, and it doesn't talk about the value they create in the city and where that goes. That's finacialization, capturing those benefits is what capitalists are doing now.
% rent is being in the house/what they pay, the transfer of money, vs what cities are, and how that produces value..

% Canada faces a housing crisis. The crisis now reaches far into the middle class, causing everything from declining home ownership rates to increasing poverty and displacement. 
%In the last few years, the need for affordable housing has come into focus as one of the most pressing issues facing Canadians. % ***E (ADD STRIKING STATISTIC - A NUMBER OR QUOTATION HERE.)

% There has been less work on the implications for productivity. 
% In this thesis we focus on the financialization of housing ownership and its impact on urban productivity in an economy driven by urban agglomeration effects. 

% The source of the rents captured and the broader social and economic effects have not been fully captured. 
 % This provides insight into both population and wealth distribution in cities. 
% Integrating financial markets into the the spatial urban model allows us to examine the effect of financialization on cities, specificaly on their role in growth, distribution, and productivity. % the growth and wealth distribution of cities, and more specifically on their productivity effects.

%\textbf{WHY IT'S BEEN MISSING} EXPLAIN BETTER HERE WHY SPACE HAS BEEN LEFT OUT, AND WHY THAT LET'S US NEGLECTS SPATIAL RENTS AND MISS THE RELATION BETWEEN SPACE AND PRODUCTIVITY.
% We see urbanization and continuing and financialization accelerating. Financialization is driven by capital seeking profits, but what is the source of the rents they capture? The answer is in conventional urban theory, which allows us to identify the spatial distribution of those rents and traditional rent theory, which allows us to understand the social relations of those, those rents, the classical economists spend a great deal of time on that question. And we're very clear about it.
%We're talking about what is the puzzle? This is the teaser for this thesis and this thesis offers an answer to and I've just started to suggest that the teaser is given that

XXXZ The current models for understanding financialization and it's effects don't predict the actual trends we are see. {\color{red} We argue this is because they miss the importance of space FIX.} 

%COMPELLING DESCRIPTION OF WHAT'S MISSING IN THE LITERATURE
%these share space, formalization in finance is spaceless



% Alternative phrasing 
%We integrate a labour market into a spatial urban model, set up to explore rent, and implications for the distribution of wealth.



 %calculate the urban surplus, and consider who gets it. 
 
% MOVE TO LIT REVIEW/CONTRIBUTION?
%: The work draws on the Alfonso/Von Thünen model of the concentric city and Dawn Parker and Filatova's work in agent-based modelling of housing markets (see http://jasss.soc.surrey.ac.uk/12/1/3.html 2009).% We begin with a simple model of a circular city with urban agglomeration effects. In subsequent sections we will use an agent-based model to relax assumptions to look at how the interaction between the production of social wealth in cities interacts with housing and the extraction of rent to drive patterns for individuals over space and time.
% Most of the analysis of urban systems has employed analytical models with roots that go back to von Thunen \cite{vonThunen} and more recently Alonso \cite{Alonso}. These models are extremely useful, but necessarily abstract from the concrete  and variable individual behaviour and  the details  of dynamics that make real cities path-dependent. XXX \cite{GET-Dawn} have shown that agent-based models can reproduce the features of the analytical models, at least in simple cases. TODO maybe divide chapter on theoretical core, followed by chapter on implementation (general for basic and resilience experiments).

\section{Contributions}

% STORY? We began with what seemed like an obvious statement, and looked for a model to do it, found the modelling tradition was blind to precisely the questions we were trying to explore, surprized, explain why?
% MOVE? The challenge is to develop a simple conceptually clear model that can be extended and used in a wide range so that the tools for thinking about ownership can be integrated and used in analysis of a wide range of ideas using conventional economic theory.
% \begin{enumerate}
%     \item we incorporate \gls{classical rent theory} into an agent-based urban model 
%     \item we allow the creation and distribution of rents to influence urban growth, productivity and  population structure. 
%     \item we incorporate current research on \gls{urban scaling} into the  core spatial urban model.   
%     \item we construct an   Urban \gls{ABM} that is consistent with \gls{neoclassical growth theory},
%     \item we integrate \gls{financial capital} into a standard spatial model of the urban system
%     \item we integrate financial capital into an population model of the urban system
%     \item we employ the ABM to examine how financial markets impact the urban land markets 
%     \item we test for \gls{hysteresis}  resulting from the business cycle  in the urban system 
%     \item we build a model that is easily extended to explore a wide range of issues

% Because we draw on a wide range of methods and literatures, we discuss the relevant literature and  methodologies in the chapters where they apply 


\chapter{COMBINE WITH RENT Background} \label{chapter-background}

% There are two dominant stories of \gls{distribution} in economics. The first and oldest is based on the classical concept of rent as explained  by David Ricardo \cite{ricardoEssayInfluenceLow1815}, in which owners of an asset are able to extract a value beyond what they contribute based on their ownership of a scarce resource. 
% The second is the marginalist approach, developed by Clark and others, in which workers and other factors  in competitive markets receive the \gls{marginal value-product} of their contribution to production. 

% Both developed in response to the specific social and economic conditions of the periods in which they emerged. Both attempt to explain where the output of society ended up within society. they are, at their heart, stories of who  claims what share of production.  Classical rent theory  emphasized the distribution of the social surplus, the part of production  over and above what was needed to reproduce society. This included only land rents initially, but was extended to the distribution of profit profits.   These are exactly the types of surplus income that are not explained by the neoclassical theory, which is  awkward because profits and rents form a substantial part of national income (20--25 percent) in the world the neoclassical model describes. In this thesis we identify classical rents intn the urban systems and exxamine their distribution.. 
% % ***E FIRSTNAME Ricardo was a INSERT NATIONALITY classical economist  in the WHICH Century. 

%Classical economics emerged in the 16$^{th}$ and 17$^{th}$ centuries at a time of exploding colonial wealth. In this period,  European economies were still structured largely around agricultural production in which farmers OR peasants work the land  owned by the descendants of feudal aristocrats. Urban economies based around factories were just beginning to emerge as significant drivers of wealth.\footnote{The Industrial Revolution is usually described as beginning around 1760 and having significantly transformed society by about 1820--1840.} % It was only after 1650 that living standards in the UK did start to increase for a sustained period. Before the modern era of economic growth, the economy worked very differently. Not technological progress, but the size of the population determined the standards of living.} 
In this economic context, the agricultural surplus is captured by feudal aristocrats. 

%As WHAT LED TO THE EXPLOSION... CHANGES IN UNIVERSITIES OR THE ECONOMY, there was an explosion of thinking about social and economic structures and systems.  This was a period where a range of thinkers explored many ideas to explain the shifting social and economic conditions. 

%Distribution, or who got what share of production was a central concern. This focus came to the forefront in the 1600s and 1700s as colonial expansion of land holdings, factories and supplied change concentrated wealth---funding investment in the arts and sciences, great fortunes---harsher conditions for farmers, pushed of their land with enclosures, and concentrated in urban factories, almost exclusively poor with---illness bad working conditions % 90 rural, population snap shot % (unprecedented in northern Europe, a relative backwater)---%gt (new ineuqlity---jusxtabosition---fortuioned unpreciendet ont hat content to rivla hsotori great- wons- woth workers dying, kids in factories- Dickens period, pesantry..---both were new- the eilsure)
% and concerned with inequality, which suited a time in which the labourers both on the land, and in the emerging factories struggled with poverty, at a time of rapidly growing
% -the intense interest spiked as wealth grew in colonial Europe. %(reformation another answer to this)
% NOTABLY THIS WAS AN URBAN TRANSITION- FARMS TO SUBURBS- POWER GROWTH, AN INFLECTION - LIKE COVID REVEALED THE NEW FORM WITH A RAPID MOBILITY CHANGE..
% The new form is the urban
% dense exchange - experience in person density can compete with screen experience -

%In this context, Ricardo refined the classical concept of rent.  

% ***E Today the word rent is usually used to refer to payments made by a tenant to a landlord to for the right to occupy a property, but this is not the traditional economic concept of  rent.  

% ***E As a concept, it's more closely related to profit / surplus than to rent paid for properties. 


% ***E NEED TO ADD HOW DOES THIS CONTRIBUTE OR EQUATE TO A THEORY OF DISTRIBUTION... WHAT DOES IT EXPLAIN...
%Ricardo's concept of rent accounted for the way that.... WHAT IT DESCRIBED. 
%This remains important to understanding distribution in general because.....


%The marginalist account describes how workers receive the marginal value of their contribution to production. THIS MEANS.....
%It formalizes what classical economist Adam Smith describes in the story of the pin factory. (EXPLAIN PIN FACTORY)

%The marginalist account of distribution gave a story of production that seemed to align with the rising fortunes of workers following WWII, in the 1950s and 1960s when it came to dominate. 

%This narrative dominates in neo-classical economics, particularly in the United States, and formed the basis of conventional micro-economics training. (EVEN NOW OR WHEN)
%It was also influential in shaping public discourse and policy in the early 20th century. For example, because it implies WHAT THAT MEANS MONOPOLY IS BAD... it provided the intellectual foundation for anti-monopoly political movements in the early 20th century.

\textbf{These two stories each reflect a distinct dominant mode of production}, period in society, and methodological set of tools available.From the Classical to Neo-Classical economic approaches, we also see development in the methodological approaches to describing economies. In Ricardo's era, economics was characterized by a free flowing descriptive approach characterized by wide debate, and many concepts explored. By the the time the marginalist approach emerged, new mathematical approaches were beginning to emerge OR dominate the economic discourse. 

SUMMARIZE THE DIFFERENCE IN WHAT EACH MODEL TELLS US ABOUT DISTRIBUTION. WHAT IS OVERALL DIFFERENT, WHAT DIFFERENT INSIGHTS EMERGE. 

\section{This Work}

\textbf{This thesis contributes to a third theory} % ***E IS THIS RIGHT?? I CHANGED IT TO THEORy OF DISTRIBUTION FROM THEORY OF MODERN URBAN RENT WHICH IS NOT THE CATEGORY WE ARE DISCUSSEING THEORIES FOR SO IT DOESNT MAKE SENES
of distribution by developing a theory of modern urban rent which integrates the classical descriptive work on rent and the neoclassical marginalist approach, with modern work on the scaling of wealth in cities. 

Just as the classical and neo-classical approaches \textbf{responded to and theorized the dominant mode of production in their time,} the theoretical framework emerging now, responds to the economic and social factors that are defining this period.  The early stories of production from thinkers like Ricardo centred on exploring who claimed the surplus from agricultural production Over time, the story moved to industrial production. Now the center of production is increasingly  WHAT KIND OF WORK (% ***E SAYING IT IS URBAN CHANGES THE SUBJECT TO LOCATION FROM TYPE OF WORK).
Industrialization shifted the centres of wealth to cities and since then the economic importance of cities has only grown. (%***E IS THIS SO?).  
% CUT : The social wealth of cities/human capacities developed in cities is central in new world where the production of value by people in cities 

NEED A CLEAR STATEMENT HERE ABOUT WHAT CITIES ARE ACTUALLY DOING. 
WHAT IS TANGIBLY HAPPENING IN CITIES THAT MAKES THEM SO IMPORTANT? WHAT KIND OF WORK? 
THIS IS THE PLACE TO SKETCH OUT A CLEAR AND RECOGNIZABLE PICTURE OF URBAN ECONOMIES IN THIS HISTORICAL MOMENT. ACCOUNT FOR TYPES OF WORK, COVID, ETC. 

Cities are the centres of social wealth and a wealth production. 
WHAT DOES WEALTH MEAN? 
WHAT DOES SOCIAL WEALTH MEAN?


A theory of production that doesn't center/involve the relation between cities and production/urban space and human capacity simply can't explain the creation of value in the modern world. It will miss WHAT SPECIFICALLY 

This is why is useful to draw in urban theory and spatial models (OR WHAT)

NOW SUMMARIZE IN BRIEF THE THREADS BEING BROUGHT TOGETHER. 
While econimists have focused on, URBAN THEORY has developed accoutns of WHAT????
WHAT ARE THE MAOR ACCOUNTS YOU ARE DRAWING ON? 
Meanwhile, while economists have focused on WHAT, Urban Theory has explored a different set of questions. 
WHAT DOES URBAN THEORY STUDY? WHAT KINDS OF QUESTIONS. 

This work weaves traditional economic approaches together with urban theory to contribute to a picture of distribution that accounts for how modern modern social and economic trends play out in space (FIX THIS SENTENCE)
ALSO ADD: 
key thinkers - is anyone else building the broader picture of this third story?? if not say something like "the key insights to this work have been developed separately in these different fields, this thesis pulls them into an singular account of distribution in the the current period. 


This approach also draws on the advancing\textbf{ methodological tools available}. The early classical work could reflect rich dynamic stories with many dimensions, using qualitative methods % ***E CAN YOU SAY QUALITATIVE METHODS??? I WANT TO EMPHASIZE THE DIFFERENCE IN METHODS MORE

\section{CUT/EDIT Very rough notes on the three stories of distribution}

What share do workers get- subsistence wages- get 
But as output grows, and as firms compete for labour, particularly skilled labour, is that a sufficient experience.

Following WWII with growing demand for labour labour could bargain, 
Following WWII in the period--- subsistence waves tending--- when labour could bargain,

\section{Systems Analysis}
 
 system analysis is a problem-solving technique that breaks down a system into its component pieces, and how well those parts work and interact to accomplish their purpose . (Wikipedia)

The field of system analysis relates closely to requirements analysis or to operations research. It is also "an explicit formal inquiry carried out to help a decision maker identify a better course of action and make a better decision than they might otherwise have made."[2] 

The discipline of what is today known as policy analysis originated from the application of system analysis when it was first instituted by United States Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara.

practitioners of system analysis can be called upon to document existing systems 

Systems engineering is an interdisciplinary field of engineering and engineering management that focuses on how to design, integrate, and manage complex systems over their life cycles. At its core, systems engineering utilizes systems thinking principles to organize this body of knowledge. 

The systems engineering process must begin by discovering the real problems that need to be resolved, and identifying the most probable or highest impact failures that can occur — systems engineering involves finding solutions to these problems.

2. manage regime not state- the overarching pattern, such as the distributional features of the economy. 

% human engineering has aproblematic history

``we require a degree of humility in working with complex systems, recognizing that the precautionary principle, a greater margin of safety, may be required to avoid the hubris of human over-confidence in pushing systems too close to the edge of catastrophic state transitions, unrecoverable hysteresis loops, unanticipated power-law extrema, or complex cascading failures.''

And more generally the principles of how to promise offer a path forward. 

Resilience is not about state, its about regimes, it can be about about how to protect as much choice as possible.

Resilience is a principle we put here in methodology.
