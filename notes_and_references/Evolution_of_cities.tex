It is clear that cities city systems and city economies are complex systems. Complex systems are sensitive to scale and tend to generate emergent properties over time. In the history of cities we discern a series of transitions arising out of growing size and complexity. There is no reason to  think that evolution has stopped. In fact, our analysis has focused on a significant transition that is currently underway. The transformation of cities as humans become an urban species has had a series of stages, each of which was tied to production technologies and largely determined social relations of the period.
