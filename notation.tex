Notation: 
Agent counts and indices are subscripts.
Values related to time are superscripts, time as a continuous 
variable is small, a period is capitalized e.g. the period $T$ of some number of years. 
In general values are capitals, rates are small letters.

It might be better to use the subscript $m$ for `market'.  for warranted rents

\section{Additional assumptions}
\begin{enumerate}
\item There is full employment, no frictional unemployment, and no labour adjustment costs.
\item Firms set output and factor inputs to maximize profits, so factors are paid the value of their marginal private product
\item Demand for output is perfectly elastic (constant price = 1)
\end{enumerate}


Rural producers pay a wage $\psi$. this covers a standard house, lot, entertainment, diet and consumption pattern. We  choose units so that per-period cost of a unit of productive capital is also $\psi$
