This thesis is a study of the \gls{financialization} of the urban housing market, and particularly the system-level effects of financialization on distribution and urban productivity.  In recent years financialized ownership of housing has increased in Canada while homeownership rates have declined \cite{statisticscanadaBuyRentHousing2022}.
70\% of new condo units in Ontario are purchased by investors \cite{GET_ontario_condo_ownership}.  About a third of the value of owner-occupied homes in Canada is held as mortgages. In other words, about a third of the net land rents associated with owner-occupied housing accrues to the financial sector. Since 66\% of Canadian homes are owner-occupied, roughly 5/9 of the Canadian housing stock is currently owned as financial assets \cite{nemtinFinancializationHousingSocial2021} and the fraction is increasing. % blackstone.

Financialization is, in a broad sense, the capture by financial actors of streams of surplus generated by society.\footnote{There is a difference between investment in productive capital and investment in financial assets. The first contributes to total social output while the second is simply a transfer of ownership. The traditional distinction between capitalists and \glspl{rentier} pivots on this distinction. Capitalists invest in creating productive assets while rentiers live off the income generated by productive assets previously created. At the level of the economy as a whole, financialization can be seen as diverting savings from capitalist investment to rent-seeking investment. The economic system  that emerges as the process continues is sometimes described as rentier-capitalism \cite{christophersClassAssetsWork2021,  standingCorruptionCapitalismWhy2017}. In this thesis we are not concerned with the issues around the emergence of rentier capitalism, but mention it here to acknowledge the connection of this work to another literature.}  Economists distinguish between productive and financial capital where the the fundamental nature of productive capital is that the value of output generated is greater than value of the inputs, with the difference being called a surplus. Financial capital, on the other hand, is capital applied to capturing surplus for the owners of the capital  rather than producing a surplus. Financial actors are persons or institutions in the economy focused on using capital to capture surplus from production. Thomas Palley \cite{palleyFinancializationWhatIt2007} describes financialization as ``a process whereby financial markets, financial institutions, and financial elites gain greater influence over economic policy and economic outcomes.'' The accumulation of economic power  and has been associated with a profound shift in the distribution of wealth and political power. %As we've seen through the examples in this chapter, 

In urban housing markets, the value of land in a city arises from its (indirect) role in production. Owning the land and housing in a city is therefore a way of capturing the flow of value produced by the city itself. Financialization of the housing market happens as land and property are represented by financial instruments and bought and sold on financial markets. 

At the micro level, financialization is achieved through the development of legal and financial instruments that allow for exchange. These instruments become the building blocks enabling the process of financialization. They allow financial actors to focus on capturing the future value produced by real assets through trading instruments that represent that value.\footnote{Financial instruments, like the shares issued by a joint stock company, have been used to facilitate productive and often investments. Financial instruments are not in general tied to productive activity, however. }


In order to explain financialization, we will begin with an analogy with digitization to illustrate how the process works at the micro and macro level. We will then briefly discuss financial instruments such as stocks, mortgages, and Real Estate Investment Trusts, give historical context for financialization both as a broader trend and within the housing market, and then discuss potential systems-level effects of financialization on urban systems.


\section{Financialization is a process like digitization}

We can see in the  financialization of the urban system an \gls{emergent} phenomenon, analogous to the emergence of ubiquitous \gls{digitization}.
In both transitions, emergent social process are driven by individual micro-level actions that interact to produce new  and unexpected outcomes at the macro-level

Digitization is the replacement of analog processes and tools with digital version. Through the late 20$^{th}$ century to the present, activities have increasingly shifted from being analog operations on material and mechanical systems to digital content manipulated on micro-electronic devices. 
This revolution happened at different scales. At the micro-level, there was the development of technologies, such as transistors, integrated circuits, and the wide array of products built from them, including mainframe computers, laptops, and smartphones.  These micro-level innovations interact to form emergent systems level changes. At this macro-level, digitization represented a fundamental system change, reducing transactions and transformation costs, and creating a vast array of digital products that are almost costless to reproduce and distribute. Digitization created huge new industries like video streaming, electronic monies, and coding. It has also vastly expanded other industries, %like streaming and delivery systems,
cut costs, expanded consumer choice, %as services like Amazon become so successfully, 
and hugely increased the dissemination of intellectual content through electronic publishing and in movie and music creation.   
%  change the mind society to Google vs to think, come to talk with each other. communications, algorithms, inteligences, categories, minds

Digitization was not and is not a planned process, but rather the result of millions of individual decisions, each in pursuit of specific, local, individual goals, and ideas about what is happening in the system. The pursuit of these goals supported the development of  new supply chains and institutions. %As with financialization, 
The cumulative effect is a systems level change with wide-ranging effects.  

Like digitization, financialization is an emergent and transformative feature of the economy. It happens at the microeconomic level, where individual decisions are made, financial instruments are created and real assets are bought by individuals and institutions. It also has system-level effects as markets become financialized and wealth is diverted to financial actors. Ultimately, financialization transforms the functioning of economic systems at both the  micro and macro levels'' \cite{palleyFinancializationWhatIt2007}.

\section{Instruments of financialization }

% In Financialization, legal and financial instruments are like the products that enabled the digitization of a increasingly wide range of activities. %that make digitization possible:  %, and financial instruments have been central to the housing system for a long time. 
% in the housing market and in the broader financial system. % 
%Examples of financialization outside the housing system include stocks and stock markets. 
To financialize something requires a \gls{financial instrument} with two primary features: first, it represents something of value, and second, it can be bought and sold as an investment. These instruments represent rights to packages of surplus value that can be redeemed in the future, converting the product of real-world activities into financial assets that can be traded easily.   %THAT ALLOWS FINANCIAL ACTORS TO CAPTURE THE VALUE FROM THE REAL ASSETS THROUGH TRADING INSTRUMENTS REPRESENTING THAT VALUE. 

There are many different legal and financial instruments among the building blocks of a financialized system. The most well-known and quintessential financial instrument is a stock which represents the share of the profit or loss of an enterprise that the stockholder has claim to. Stocks form the basis of the modern stock market. %are an important

Stocks have their roots in the European colonial period and are among the most important financial instruments in the modern economy. %capitalist economy.  
They originated as a financing mechanism for the \gls{joint-stock company},  
% The development of 
%fundamentally just a financial instrument  
which facilitates the pooling of investor funds with specific legal protections. It provides a powerful example of a financial instrument that ultimately transformed the economy. 

There are records of joint-stock companies being formed in Europe as early as the 13$^{th}$ century. At this time, the basic features of stocks as financial instruments were already in place. They represented ownership of a future flow of profit or loss. Originally a tool to allow a group of investors to pool their money, take on large projects, and share the risks, stocks themselves rapidly became objects of trade and speculation with the formation of the first stock market in Amsterdam in 1611. 
A stock market allows promoters to sell shares in new companies and allows stockholders to buy and sell existing stocks. 
%A market for stocks then makes possible emergent phenomena like bubbles and crashes. 
Because stocks allow for speculation based on hopes of rising prices, their existence very quickly gave rise to the emergent phenomena of financial bubbles which still plague modern markets. 



% Share prices on the stock market are not tightly tied to the productivity of the company they represent, illustrating how the financial instrument can diverge from the real asset, and making it clear that the financial instrument is something different from the real asset. % Stock transactions can also be speculative. Most stock transactions are speculative in nature 
% Financial instruments can be combined and new types of instruments built on top of them. For example, mutual funds, which pool more risky stocks, in an effort to offer more reliable returns, are a financial instrument built on top of the stock market.
% Over time these developments have produced substantial systems-level effects. \cite{hayCommonTrajectoriesVariable2004}

Joint-stock companies multiplied beginning in the 16$^{th}$ century, providing a mechanism for channeling investment into colonial projects. The Virginia joint-stock company was chartered in 1607, not only to create new trading opportunities but also to establish colonies in the acquired lands of North America.  It was the Virginia Company's London branch that established the first permanent English settlement in the New World. The East India Company was founded in 1600 to trade in the Indian Ocean region, initially with the East Indies and later with East Asia. The company funded armies, seized control of large parts of the Indian subcontinent, and colonized parts of Southeast Asia and Hong Kong. At its peak, the company was the largest corporation in the world. 

The development of the joint-stock company, a financial tool, enabled both political takeovers and a vast expansion of global markets, which in turn helped drive economic growth and technical innovation, changed wealth flow at a global level, and changed ecosystems, power structures, cultural practices, and even what languages people spoke. The financial instrument enabled investors to capture the wealth of less developed regions, and that shift had a permanent impact on systems at a global level. % language use%and even changes in cultural practices, language use, education, and more. 


There is disagreement about how much stock investment is simply speculation on potential price changes and how much creates productive real assets.\footnote{Mork et al. identify four theories that attempt to explain the correlation between stock returns and subsequent investment \cite{morckStockMarketInvestment1990}. \begin{quotation}The first says that the stock market is a passive predictor of future activity that managers do not rely on to make investment decisions allow promoters to sell shares in new companies.. The second theory says that, in making investment decisions, managers rely on the stock market as a source of information, which may or may not be correct about future fundamentals. The third theory, which is perhaps the most common view of the stock markets influence, says that the stock market affects investment through its influence on the cost of funds and external financing. Finally, the fourth theory says that the stock market exerts pressure on investment quite aside from its informational and financing role, because managers have to cater to investors' opinions in order to protect their livelihood. For example, a low stock price may increase the probability of a takeover or a forced removal of top management. If the market is pessimistic about the firm's profitability, top management may be deterred from investing heavily by the prospect of further erosion in the stock price.\end{quotation} None of these point to a direct connection between stock market investment and real investment.}

\section{Financialization globally}

productive capital to financial capital ... shoft like shoft from analog to digital... 

Financialization is a global phenomena. It can be measured as an increase in the stock of financial assets associated with a stock of some set of real assets. For this reason, the term is often used as a collective noun for the growth in the number and/or size of transactions, creating or transferring financial assets to financialized ownership \cite{GET_financialization-numberOfTransactions}. % These transactions typically occur through a \gls{market}.  
% While there is no clear point in time when global financialization began, 
% In 2013, wrote that 
It is this sense Tomaskovic-Devey and Lin use when they wrote in 2013 ``[t]he U.S. is now a financialized economy, where the financial sector and its priorities have become increasingly dominant in all aspects of the economy'' \cite{tomaskovic-deveyFinancializationCausesInequality2013}. Christophers argued in 2015 that approximately 40\% of the economy was financialized. Aalbers, however, points out that, since many financialized firms are classified as part of the real economy, 40\% may be a substantial underestimate. \cite{aalbersPotentialFinancialization2015}.



Markets in different jurisdictions are regulated differently, so the effects vary across countries. There is, however, a ‘common trajectory’ \cite{hayCommonTrajectoriesVariable2004}\cite{aalbersConversationLandRent2018} in which local economies evolve from different starting points subject to similar economic pressures.



While there is not a single point at which financialization began, it has arguably become increasingly significant because of the expansion of financial capitalism during the period from 1970 to the present. Over that period,  debt-to-equity ratios increased and financial services accounted for an increasing share of national income relative to other sectors. Thomson and Dutta, \cite{thomsonFinancialisationPrimer2018}, suggest that August 15$^{th}$, 1971, when American President Richard Nixon announced that the United States would unpeg its currency from gold, marks a turning point in the financialization of the economy. This accelerated growth in global liquidity and prompted a surge of financial liberalisation and deregulation and undermined the Bretton Woods System. Synthetic derivatives were created soon after: The Chicago Mercantile Exchange launched futures contracts written on financial instruments the following year and the Chicago Board of Trade introduced the first interest rate future contracts three years later. Arbitrage, options trading, and various other activities grew exponentially. By 2011, the over-the-counter (OTC) and exchange-traded derivatives market amounted to almost \$800 trillion. Wijburg et al \cite{wijburgFinancialisationRentalHousing2018} argue that rapid financialization of housing markets in Germany, Spain, the US and elsewhere  took place in the seven years before the global financial crisis  of 2007. 

%Financialization occurs at the micro-level through the development of instruments, and at the macro-level through larger system-level effects. 



\subsection{Mortgages}

A financial instrument that changed the structure of the housing market is the mortgage. 
Mortgages began as contract that enabled individuals to make purchases larger than their savings - mainly purchase properties.   They have become a financial asset that can be bought and sold as property in themselves. This allows investors to purchase mortgages as assets when they think the return is higher than the return on other assets.  When mortgages become an easily exchanged financial asset, they begin to serve as a channel for money to move into the housing market, not to produce additional housing for the market, but to capture value from the market. The two uses of mortgages demonstrate two distinct uses of financial instruments.  

Mortgages have always allowed lenders to participate in housing purchases in the present in exchange for a future flow of payments. The mortgage does not by itself create housing, but it enables a prospective buyer to become the nominal owner of an asset that produces a stream of benefits that may include a place to live, proximity to work or services, natural features, or other amenities. The value of housing is set by the market to factor in not just the features of the home itself, but the locational value of the property based on the stream of benefits provided. 

Because the value of the stream of benefits from secure housing near a source of income generally exceeds a buyer's current assets, mortgages enable the transfer of ownership by making it possible to transfer the rights to a substantial fraction of the future income of the mortgagee to the mortgage-holder. The mortgage holder a right to the title until the terms of the mortgage are fulfilled.  If the mortgagee fails to make those payments, the mortgage-holder can repossess the asset. The security provided by this instrument ``de-risks'' the transaction, making it safer and therefore easier to achieve the mutual benefits of the sale. 

The additional step of making these mortgages tradable on a market is required to create a financialized market. Originally mortgages were an arrangement between just the buyer and the seller, but in the 1870s in the USA, insurance companies stepped into these transactions, paying off the seller and then collecting the principle and interest payments on behalf of the bank's shareholders. This innovation was an example of financialization in that it made it possible for financial actors, in this case,  insurance companies, to profit by providing money to buyers. It also had systemic effects, making homeownership accessible for more people. When mortgage lending was regulated and insured  by the American government during and after the great depression it facilitated a further massive increase in home ownership in the USA and contributed to the post-war construction boom and the suburbanization of American cities. 

The housing market was thus initially financialized by the market for insurance-backed mortgages, but these mortgages were still agreements between individual lenders and buyers. When financial institutions later developed markets that let them buy and sell bundles of mortgages among themselves, we say the mortgage market itself was financialized. This added % ADD DATE
a secondary market for the promises to pay that every mortgage represents on top of the market for housing financed by mortgage-type loans.
%

The addition of new levels of financialization does not necessarily affect the functioning of the lower-level financial instruments. Buying and selling packages of mortgages does not directly affect the condition of the individual mortgages---they simply add a new product for investors or banks to buy and sell. 

Introducing such markets can have an effect at another level, however. The new market in bundled mortgages, for example, was thought to further reduce the risk for lenders, but between 2007 and 2010 in the USA the sub-prime mortgage crisis destabilized the financial institutions that were playing this new market.\footnote{Arguably, that crisis resulted from overselling risky and predatory mortgages by lenders with more money to lend than the market could absorb. Eager investors seeking higher or more secure returns were willing to buy bundles of mortgages that were in theory de-risked. Pooling uncorrelated individual risk, as the insurance industry does, produces lower overall risk. (The instruments that enabled the speculative bubble were mortgage-backed securities (MBSs) and collateralized debt obligations (CDOs).) Pooling does not reduce systemic risk, however. As it turned out, the mortgage default rate rose, lenders' liquidity fell, mortgage rates were pushed up, defaults increased, and the market for the new instruments collapsed, taking down major financial institutions and providing a cautionary tale about the potential dangers of financialization.} 
This is an example of a cross-scale effect of the type that we are exploring in this thesis.  

% Note that mortgages are clearly financial instruments, but 

% The promise to pay embedded in a mortgage captures the value of the stream of house payments. It can be exchanged and is freely traded in financial markets. If debt is central, the share of the financialized ownership.

If financialization is understood as the increase in the share of surpluses claimed by investors, not all financial instruments are instruments of financialization. Mortgages have clearly facilitated home construction, but the financialization of mortgages led to to expanded mortgage debt on the consumer side, higher home prices, higher mortgages, and ultimately an an increase in the share of the benefits produced by the housing stock going to financial actors. 

%an do that, allowing some to invest in and claim a disproportionate share of future urban productivity. They may also function to transfer ownership of property to at least some individual community members, perhaps transferring the asset from the financial interests which funded development, to local distributed ownership, by community members primarily concerned with the use value of living in the house. This not only localizes distributes ownership of the stream of surpluses, and potentially acts to decouple it from larger financial interests and cycles.

\subsubsection{Investment trusts}
% allow vastly more inflow of finance into housing markets. 

The process of financialization of the housing market has also involved the development of new financial instruments, that are specifically suited to financialized ownership of housing. An example of a financial instrument designed specifically to support rent extraction and which increases the degree of financialization of the housing supply is the Real Estate Investment Trust (\gls{REIT}). There are other large owners of residential real estate such as life insurance companies and pension plans that behave similarly, but REITs are a relatively new financial instrument, the use of which is expanding rapidly and attracting political attention for their effect on housing markets.

A REIT is a company that owns, operates, or finances income-generating real estate and distributes the income to shareholders. While the company itself is a management system, the shares are simply financial assets that are sold to individuals and organizations that want to share in real estate revenues and capital gains. Like mortgages, REITS are financial instruments, but, unlike mortgages, they directly expand financialization of the housing market by buying housing on behalf of financial actors.

Developed in the USA  in 1960 (as an amendment to the Cigar Excise Tax Extension!) and introduced in Canada in 1993 \cite{GET_REITsDevelopedDates}, REITs are similar to mutual funds in that they make it possible for an individual, often small investors, to earn dividends from real estate investments without having to buy, manage, or finance any properties themselves. REITs can offer high rates of return because they actively push up rents using several devices \cite{GET-Martine-August, farhaReportFinancializationHousing2017}. 
 % REITs that develop new properties generally don't sell the properties they construct. 
An S\&P-Dow Jones research bulletin reported that over the 25 years to 2017, REITs outperformed stocks, bonds, and commodities \cite{GET-Dow-Jones-research-bulletin}. Because they have outperformed competing investments they have attracted capital from other uses, particularly during the recent period of low interest rates.\footnote{There are questions about preferential tax treatment, and whether some REITs are essentially inappropriately sheltered real-estate corporations.} For the purpose of this thesis, REITs are simply one of the mechanisms for the financialization of housing.


% IMPORTANT - ADD BACK!

% Mortgages can influence the system in a number of ways. ADD %When we consider urban housing, 
% A mortgage is the right to future income generated by capital, labour, and the city itself through the agglomeration effects that drive productivity.

REITs also have system-level effects. %are not a neutral tool for saving either. 
According to a paper \cite{wangAnalyzeImpactREITs2021} on REITS in the Irish housing market, ``REIT successfully reconnected the international financial market and the Irish real estate market.'' In other words, in Ireland, REITs have made it easier for international capital to buy Irish land. The entry of outside and footloose capital has affected the resident population:  ``the large-scale acquisition of Irish real estate by REITs and other real estate buyers has also caused some new problems. First, the active management of assets by REITs and other investors has led to a rapid increase in rents.''\footnote{In  IMF working paper ``Capital Account Liberalization and Inequality'' \cite{furceriCapitalAccountLiberalization2015}  Furceri and Loungani reported that that for 149 countries from 1970 to 2010, ``after countries take steps to open their capital account, an increase in inequality in incomes within countries follows.'' The observation is consistent with our argument that domestic \gls{rent-seeking} in housing markets will increase inequality.}  

There is evidence that REITs affect real estate markets in other ways. Bat et al.  \cite{batRolePublicREITs2022} report that  ``they are actually financial actors that aggressively buy up property assets and manage them to extract wealth at taxpayers' expense.'' and ``they have expanded the pool of capital available for transactions that monetize real property and turn it into tradable assets---financial widgets with little or no connection to the real purpose of the productive enterprises that occupy the properties they own.''

%A third aspect of the word financialization is these system level effects of financialization.

We have called attention in this section to the development of several important financial instruments---stocks, stock markets, derivatives, mortgages, and REITs---with the intention of  disentangling the concept of financial instruments from the term ``financialization.'' %The development of instruments facilitates the process of financialization, but is not, in itself, financialization.  
To illustrate the potential for systemic shifts, we have described some of the system-level effects of the widespread adoption of the two instruments for the financialization of housing described earlier, mortgages and REITs. 



% This process of financialization also has profound impact at systems level. 
% And the word financialization, at the macro level, refers to this set of impacts.

%Jaimison goes further and argues that the material and economic relations can actually structure our relation to society and ourselves, and even the ability to solve problems (e.g. methaprical structures limit ability to deal with societal crises like climate change).




\subsection{Financialization of the Urban System } 

Financialization of housing is an inherently spatial phenomenon that should be analysed in an economic–geographic framework \cite{aalbersPotentialFinancialization2015}. In this thesis, we focus on the distributional and productivity effect of the financialization of housing underway in the Canadian  urban system. 


The financialization of the urban system is not a new discovery, however. 
%speculation and fashion replace enterprise and morality, and the immense improvement of the urban fabric, belies an intense degeneration of the human condition.

This agenda has given a platform for a new style of urban politics, based on a competition to attract, capture and monopolise the resources needed to dominate the ‘global technological frontier’ of financial and human capital.}
Moreno \cite{morenoUrbanProcessFinancialised2014} points to Zola''z 1872 novel \textit{The Kill}, which ``offers a vivid account of the marauding social and cultural forms finance-capital assumes in the process of urbanisation.'' where ‘"mortgage-loan machine[s]'' yield ``useless luxury and real penury.'' The pattern that Zola observes is underway in modern  cities.  Moreno then goes on to argue that in the modern global city,

Henri Lefebvre in 1970 %\textit{The Urban Revolution} 
\cite{lefebvreRevolutionUrbaine1970, lefebvreUrbanRevolution2003} reintroduced the analysis of financial capital in urban systems within a Marxist framework, claiming that  
\begin{quotation}
     ‘Real property’ (along with construction) is no longer a secondary form of circulation, no longer the the auxiliary and balanced branch of industry and financial capitalism that it once was. Instead it has a leading role, 
\end{quotation}
Lefebvre's point was that instead of passively following the growth of industial capital, which had historically been the site of capital expansion,  owning property  had  become the site of capital expansion.  Through the 1970s and 1980s, David Harvey \cite{harveyClassmonopolyRentFinance1974} developed and expanded Lefebvre’s  hypothesis about the role of the urban system in financial capital accumulation by showing how rent seeking and finance capital merge in the urban process. The fifty-year old Lefebvre-Harvey analysis lingers in some academic circles but has has no noticeable impact on policy in Canada or the USA.\footnote{On the recent history of the term ``financialization,'', Aalbers observes that, ``[t]he concept of financialization has been used for a couple of decades by a small group of academics and other intellectuals, for example in the circle surrounding the Marxist Monthly Review (e.g. Sweezy, 1995), but it is only since the global financial crisis that started in 2007, that the term has acquired the status of a popular concept in a range of literatures spanning the different social sciences and the humanities.'' \cite{aalbersVariegatedFinancializationHousing2017}}

%\subsection{The microeconomics of  financialization} \label{section-micro} 


\section{Summary} 
Financialization of the housing market is the increasing control of the stock of urban land and housing by investors in order to capture the scarcity rent generated by the people of the city, and the system-level effects of that increasing control.  In this chapter, we've discussed what this means at the level of finance and the development of particular financial and legal instruments, at the micro-economic level as these instruments are taken up, and we've introduced some of the broader macro system effects of this process of financialization. The rest of the dissertation is a further exploration of the systemic effects of this process.

% A world wehre the---the process is the capture, with or without intent. The process is defined at the micro level. The macro level results are inherent in that process. Our whole appraoch is centered on talking about the macro level phenomena, while holding rigorous grounding in the micro level of individual reactions, actions, motivations - it becomes a structure that can be filled out on many levels.

% ADD BACK Each act in the process of financialization is directed toward the capture of the streams of the surplus created by society. Each is implemented  through particular legal or financial structures, which is to say through social technologies. Success leads to wider adoption of those technologies or rules. The system-level impacts of the growing use of these technologies is the  subject of this thesis. In particular, this thesis focuses on the potential macro effects of financial capital capturing spatial urban rents. 

% The opportunity to capture a part of the urban surplus leads to the creation of new financial instruments and ultimately may change the structure of the urban housing system

% ''Financialization is the process of capturing streams of surplus generated by society. The agglomeration processes that creates cities produces a growing stream of surplus and some of it appears as locational rents. Fianncialization of the housing market is the process capturing a larger share of urban locational rents. 

% Financialization is a process of capturing rents. It can be understood as a social innovation \dots

 
% There are three components

% there's the invention, the adoption,and the set of systems impacts.


% The analogy with digitization is worth extending.
% Can be understood as analagous to digitization. 
% ***E %tHIS PARAGRAPH IS AWKWARD TO READ
% In the development of information technology, there are particular technologies, which are developed and refined. For instance the transistor. Basically a logic switch. There is nothing new about a switch but they can be made so small they can be combined together into devices, calculators and eventually mainframe computers that research institutes purchased. The one at the Davis Center filled a whole floor, people wrote whole programs
% and there's this painstaiking phase, teaching the computer what people knew.
% The series of devices, mainframes, then personal computers, then phones miniaturization made computing ubiquitous.

% ADD BACK As with digitization of the economy, any single act, the adoption of one computer, had little effect. People find an action that can be profitable, see a local opportunity, replace one mechanical calculator with a digital calculator, but the collective effect was large.  There are many system level impacts: banks lay off half their workers, the devices can talk to each other, connect vast data sets, etc.
