Financialization is the capture of streams of surplus generated by society by financial actors.\footnote{There is a difference between investment in productive capital and investment in financial assets. The first contributes to total social output while the second is simply a transfer of ownership. The traditional distinction between capitalists and \glspl{rentier} pivots on this distinction. Capitalists invest in creating productive assets while  rentiers live off the income generated by productive assets previously created. At the level of the economy as a whole, financialization can be seen as diverting savings from capitalist investment to rent-seeking investment. The economic system  that emerges as the process continues is sometimes described as rentier-capitalism \cite{christophersClassAssetsWork2021,  standingCorruptionCapitalismWhy2017}. In this thesis we are not concerned with the issues around the emergence of rentier capitalism, but mention it here simply to  acknowledge the connection of this work to another literature.} It occurs at the micro-level through the development of instruments, and at the macro level through larger system level effects. This thesis is a study of the financialization of the housing market, and particularly the system level effects of financialization on distribution and urban productivity. 

We are concerned with the system level effects of fiancialization, but to understand those effects, one must first understand the whole process, beginning with what financialization is, and the financial tools, the building blocks of financialization.

In this thesis, we explore the systemic effects of financialization on urban productivity. In this chapter, we introduce financialization, using the analogy with digitization, look at how financial instruments within the housing system, such as mortgages, and more recently Real Estate Investment Trusts function as building blocks of financialization, then discuss potential systems level effects of financialization.


Financialization can be measured as an increase in the stock of financial assets associated with a stock of some set of real assets. This is why the term is often used as a collective noun for the growth in the number and/or size of  transactions, creating or transferring financial assets to financialized ownership \cite{GET_financialization-numberOfTransactions}. % These transactions typically occur through a \gls{market}.  
% While there is no clear point in time when global financialization began,

It is this sense  Tomaskovic-Devey and Lin use when they wrote in 2013, ``The U.S. is now a financialized economy, where the financial sector and its priorities have become increasingly dominant in all aspects of the economy''\cite{tomaskovic-deveyFinancializationCausesInequality2013}, 

While there is not a single point at which financialization began, its dominance has arguably consolidated through the expansion of financial capitalism during the period from 1970 to present, in which debt-to-equity ratios increased and financial services accounted for an increasing share of national income relative to other sectors. Thomson and Dutta, \cite{thomsonFinancialisationPrimer2018}, suggest that August 15$^{th}$, 1971, when President Richard Nixon announced that the United States would unpeg the dollar from gold, marks a turning point in the financialization of the economy. This accelerated growth in global liquidity and prompted a surge of financial liberalisation and deregulation and undermined the Bretton Woods System. Synthetic derivatives were created soon after: The Chicago Mercantile Exchange launched futures contracts written on financial instruments the following year and the Chicago Board of Trade introduced the first interest rate future contracts three years later. Arbitrage, options trading, and various other activities grew exponentially. By 2011, the over-the-counter (OTC) and exchange-traded derivatives market amounted to almost \$800 trillion.

Financialization  a global phenomena. Markets in different jurisdictions are regulated differently so the effects vary across countries. In this thesis we refer most often to housing market data for Canada and Ontario. In our discussion we move between general historical trends, we draw on American financial history because of its significance on the global financial stage, but use specific and numbers from Canada.

Since 66\% of Canadian homes are owner-occupied,  5/9 of the Canadian housing stock is owned as financial assets.  \cite{nemtinFinancializationHousingSocial2021}. % blackstone. CHECK




\section{Finacialization is a process like digitization}

To understand what this means, we can think about financialization as something like the process of \gls{digitization}. 
Through the late 20$^{th}$ century to the present, activities have increasingly shifted from being the analog operations of material, mechanical systems  to digital content manipulated digitally on micro-electronic devices. 

The digital revolution  happens at different levels or scales. At the micro level there is the development of technologies, such as transistors, integrated circuits, and the wide array of products built from them including mainframe computers, laptops, and smartphones.  

At the macro level, digitization, like financialization, represents a fundamental  system  change, reducing transactions and transformation costs, but also creating a vast array of digital products that  are almost costless to reproduce and distribute. Digitization has created huge new industries like video streaming and electronic monies, and coding. It has vastly expanded other industries, %like streaming and delivery systems,
cut transaction costs, and expended consumer choice, %as services like Amazon become so successfully, 
and hugely increased the dissemination of intellectual content though electronic publishing and in movie and music creation.   
%  change the mind society to Google vs to think, come to talk with each other. communications, algorithms, inteligences, categories, minds

Digitization was not and is not a planned process, but rather the result of millions of individual decisions, each in pursuit of specific, local, individual goals, and ideas about what is happening in the system. The pursuit of these goals supported the development of  new supply chains and institutions. As with financialization, the cumulative effect was a systems level change with wide ranging effects.  Like  financialization, digitization is an emergent and transformative feature of the economy.

\section{Instruments of financialization }
To financialize something requires a \gls{financial instrument}, with two primary features: first that it represents something of value, and second, that it can be bought and sold as an investment. These instruments represent rights to packages of surplus value that can be redeemed in the future, converting the product of real-world activities into financial assets that can be traded easily. 

At the micro level, therefore, financialization is achieved through the development of legal and financial instruments that allow for exchange. These instruments become the building blocks enabling the process of financialization. There are numerous kinds of legal and financial instruments.
% In Financialization, legal and financial instruments are like the products that enabled the digitization of a increasingly wide range of activities. %that make digitization possible:  %, and financial instruments have been central to the housing system for a long time.

% The development of

facilitates the pooling of investor funds with specific legal protections. It provides a powerful example of a financial instrument that ultimately transformed the economy. There are records of joint-stock companies being formed in Europe as early as the 13$^{th}$ century. They multiplied beginning in the 16$^{th}$ century. The Virginia joint-stock company was chartered in 1607, not only for the purpose of creating new trading opportunities, but also for the purpose of establishing colonies in the acquired lands of North America.  It was the Virginia Company's London branch that established the first permanent English settlement in the New World. The East India Company was founded in 1600 to trade in the Indian Ocean region, initially with the East Indies and later with East Asia. The company funded armies, seized control of large parts of the Indian subcontinent, and colonised parts of Southeast Asia and Hong Kong. At its peak, the company was the largest corporation in the world. 

The development the joint-stock company, a financial tool, enabled both political takeover and a vast expansion of global markets, which in turn helped drive economic growth and technical innovation, changed wealth flow at a global level, and changed ecosystems, power structures, cultural practices, and even what languages people spoke.

%Stock markets are a primary means of mobilizing long-term savings and investment for fixed capital formation \cite{azfarMarketMobilizedCapital2003}. 
Stock markets make it possible- the market in stocks- manage risks, but can also allow emergent phenomena like bubbles and crases.
Originally a tool to allow a group of investors to pool their money, take on large projects, and to share risks, stocks themselves rapidly became objects of trade and speculation with the formation of  the first stock market in Amsterdam in 1611. Stock markets allow stockholders to buy and sell existing stocks, but they also allow promoters  to sell shares in new companies. There is disagreement about about how much  stock investment is simply speculation and how much creates productive real assets.\footnote{Mork et al. \cite{morckStockMarketInvestment1990} identify four theories that attempt to explain the correlation between stock returns and subsequent investment. \begin{quotation}The first says that the stock market is a passive predictor of future activity that managers do not rely on to make investment decisions. The second theory says that, in making investment decisions, managers rely on the stock market as a source of information, which may or may not be correct about future fundamentals. The third theory, which is perhaps the most common view of the stock markets influence, says that the stock market affects investment through its influence on the cost of funds and external financing. Finally, the fourth theory says that the stock market exerts pressure on investment quite aside from its informational and financing role, because managers have to cater to investors' opinions in order to protect their livelihood. For example, a low stock price may increase the probability of a takeover or a forced removal of top management. If the market is pessimistic about the firm's profitability, top management may be deterred from investing heavily by the prospect of further erosion in the stock price.\end{quotation} None of the point to a direct connection between stock market investment and real investment.} % Share prices on the stock market are not tightly tied to the productivity of the company they represent, illustrating how the financial instrument can diverge from the real asset, and making it clear that the financial instrument is something different from the real asset. % Stock transactions can also be speculative. Most stock transactions are speculative in nature 
% Financial instruments can be combined and new types of instruments built on top of them. For example, mutual funds, which pool more risky stocks, in an effort to offer more reliable returns, are a financial instrument built on top of the stock market.
% Over time these developments have produced substantial systems-level effects.

%Had armies. Changed the language, economic flow, concentration of wealth

% Instruments are built on top of thiem like mutual funds which purchase stocks and buld a portfolio, so that investors can spread their risks adcross multiple companies.  There are also whole structures of speculative instruments, that are essentially bets on the performance of other instruments. Deriviatives don't require actually purchasing stocks---they bets on the performance derived from other aspects of the economy. There are now vastly more derivatives in the economy than real assets. These bets may offer information about value, or speculation. They also may add a range of systemic risks, as there is this edifice of wealth that hangs on financial performance of a relativley small number of companies that produce something someone might want. %-profits not production


\subsection{Mortgages}
One foundational financial instrument that changed the structure of the housing market is the mortgage. 
Mortgages began as  a financial instrument that enabled individuals to make purchases larger than their saving - mainly  purchase properties.   They have become a financial asset that can be bought and sold as property in themselves. This allows investors to purchase mortgages as assets when they think the return on  return  is higher that the return on other assets.  When mortgages become an easily exchanged financial asset, they begin to serve as a channel for money to move into the housing market, not to produce additional housing for the market, but to capture value from the market. The two uses of mortgages demonstrate two aspects of financial instruments.  

Mortgages have always allowed lenders to participate in housing purchases in the present in exchange for a future flow of payments. The mortgage does not by itself create housing, but it enables a prospective buyer to become the nominal owner of an asset, in this case a house, that produces a stream of benefits such as a place to live, proximity to work, and proximity to services, natural features, or other amenities. The value of housing is set by the market to factor in not just the features of the home itself, but the locational value of the property based on the stream of benefits provided. 

Because the value of the stream of benefits from secure housing near a source of income generally exceeds a buyer's current assets, mortgages were created to  enables the transfer of ownership by making it possible to transfer the rights to a substantial fraction of the future income of the buyer or mortgagee to the mortgage holder. In effect, the mortgage holder remains the property owner until the terms of the mortgage are fulfilled.  If the mortgagee fails to make those payments, the mortgage holder will repossess the asset. The security provided by this instrument ``de-risks'' the transaction, making it safer and therefore easier to achieve the mutual benefits of the sale. 

The additional step of making these mortgages tradable on a market is required to create a financialized market. Originally mortgages were an arrangement between just the buyer and the seller, but in the 1870s in the USA, insurance companies stepped into these transactions, paying off the seller and then collecting the principle and interest payments on behalf of the bank's shareholders. This innovation was an example of financialization in that it made it possible for financial actors, in this case, individual insurance companies, to profit by providing money to buyers. It also had systemic effects, making homeownership accessible for more people. When mortgage lending was regulated and insured  by the American government during and after the great depression it facilitated a further massive increase in home ownership in the USA and contributed to the post-war construction boom and the suburbanization of American cities. 

The housing market was thus initially financialized by the market for insurance-backed mortgages, but these mortgages were still agreements between individual lenders and buyers. When financial institutions later developed markets that let them buy and sell bundles of mortgages among themselves, we say the mortgage market itself was financialized. This added % ADD DATE

%

The addition of new levels of financialization do not (necessarily??) affect the functioning of the lower-level financial instruments. Buying ans selling packages of mortgages does not directly affect the condition  on the individual mortgages---they simply add a new product for investors or banks to buy and sell. 

Introducing such  markets can have an effect at another level, however. The new market in bundled mortgages, for example, was thought to further reduce the risk for lenders, but between 2007 and 2010 in the USA the sub-prime mortgage crisis destabilized the financial institutions that were playing this new market.\footnote{Arguably, that crisis resulted from overselling risky and predatory mortgages by lenders with more money to lend than the market could absorb. Eager investors seeking higher or more secure returns were willing  to buy bundles of  mortgages that were in theory de-risked. Pooling uncorrelated individual risk, as the insurance industry does, produces lower overall risk. (The instruments that enabled the speculative bubble were mortgage-backed securities (MBSes) and collateralized debt obligations (CDOs).) Pooling does not reduce systemic risk, however. As it turned out, the mortgage default rate rose, lenders' liquidity fell, mortgage rates were pushed up, defaults increased, and the market for the new instruments collapsed, taking down major financial institutions, providing a cautionary tale about potential costs of financialization. Analysis of that case may provide a cautionary tale about the the potential risks of financialization.} 
This is an example of a cross-scale effect of the type that we are exploring in this thesis.  

Note that mortgages are clearly, financial instruments, but not all financial instruments are instruments of financialization. Ownership of the promises to pay can be increasingly financialized---captures the value of the stream of house payments, can be exchanged, and is freely traded in financial markets. If debt is central, the share of the financialized ownership.
If financialization is the increase in the share of surpluses claimed by investors, and financialized owners, mortgages can do that, allowing some to invest in and claim a disproportinate share of future urban productivity. They may also function to transfer ownership of property to at least some individual community members, perhaps transferring the asset from the financial interests which funded development, to local distributed ownership, by community members primarily concerned with the use value of living in the house. This not only localizes distributes ownership of the stream of surpluses, and potentially acts to decouple it from larger financial interests and cycles.

\subsubsection{Investment trusts}
% allow vastly more inflow of finance into housing markets. 
The process of financialization of the housing market has also involved the development of new financial instruments, that are specifically suited to financialized ownership of housing. An example of a financial instrument designed specifically to support rent extraction and which increases the degree of financialization of the housing supply is the Real Estate Investment Trust (\gls{REIT}). 

A REIT is a company that owns, operates, or finances income-generating real estate and distribute the income to shareholders. While the company itself is an management system, the shares are are simply financial assets that are that are sold to individuals and organizations that want to share in real estate revenues and capital gains. 

Developed in the USA  in 1960 (as an amendment to the Cigar Excise Tax Extension!) and INTRODUCED? in Canada in 1993 \cite{GET_REITsDevelopedDates}, REITs are similar to mutual funds in that they make it possible for an individual, often small investors to earn dividends from real estate investments without having to buy, manage, or finance any properties themselves.They can offer high rates of return because they actively push up rents using several devices \cite{GET-Martine-August, farhaReportFinancializationHousing2017}. Like mortgages REITS are financial instruments, but they directly expand financialization of the housing market by buying housing on behalf of financial actors. 

REITs have become increasingly popular in recent years. There are other large owners of residential real estate such as life insurance companies and pension plans that behave similarly, but REITs are a relatively new financial instrument which is expanding rapidly and attracting political attention for their effect on housing markets.  % REITs that develop new properties generally don't sell the properties they construct. 
An S\&P-Dow Jones research bulletin reported that over the 25 years to 2017, REITs outperformed stocks, bonds, and commodities \cite{GET-Dow-Jones-research-bulletin}. Because they have outperformed competing investments they have attracted  capital from other uses, particularly during the recent period of low interest rates.\footnote{There are questions about preferential tax treatment, and whether some REITs are essentially inappropriately sheltered real-estate corporations.} For the purpose of this thesis, REITs are simply one of the mechanisms for the financialization of housing.

REITs invest in properties with the aim of claiming rents, and often aim to increase rents, either by investing in upgrading appartmetns, transfering costs to tennants, or displacing people. % Martine August has interviewed tenants who have had larger investor purchase their property then refuse to do things like service toilets. %Deep pockets and able to manage legal feels.

\section{Systems change}
% \section{Financialization as an emergent property}

%A third aspect of the word financialization is these system level effects of financialization.

% We have called attention in this section to the development of several important financial instruments---stocks, stock markets, derivatives, mortgages, and REITs---with the intention of  disentangling the concept of financial instruments from the term ``financialization.''

The development of instruments facilitates the process of financialization. It is not, in itself, financialization, however.
Like digitiazation, financialization also has systems level effects. 

Thomas Palley describes financialization as ``a process whereby financial markets, financial institutions, and financial elites gain greater influence over economic policy and economic outcomes. As we've seen through the examples in this chapter, Financialization transforms the functioning of economic systems at both the macro and micro levels'' \cite{palleyFinancializationWhatIt2007}.

We focus on the distributional effects, and hysteresis.

To illustrate the potential for systemic shifts, we describe some of the system level effects of the widespread adoption of instruments for the financialization of housing introduced earlier, mortgages and REITs.

REITs also have system level effects. %are not a neutral tool for saving either. 
According to a paper \cite{wangAnalyzeImpactREITs2021} on REITS in the Irish housing market, ``REIT successfully reconnected the international financial market and the Irish real estate market.'' In other words, in Ireland, REITs have made it easier for international capital to buy Irish land. The entry of outside and footloose capital has had an effect on the resident population:  ``the large-scale acquisition of Irish real estate by REITs and other real estate buyers has also caused some new problems. First, the active management of assets by REITs and other investors has led to a rapid increase in rents.''\footnote{In  IMF working paper ``Capital Account Liberalization and Inequality'' \cite{furceriCapitalAccountLiberalization2015}  Furceri and Loungani reported that that for 149 countries from 1970 to 2010, ``after countries take steps to open their capital account, an increase in inequality in incomes within countries follows.'' The observation is consistent with our argument  that domestic \gls{rent-seeking} in housing markets will increase inequality.}  

There is evidence that REITs affect real estate markets in other ways. Bat et al.  \cite{batRolePublicREITs2022} report that  ``they are actually financial actors that aggressively buy up property assets and manage them to extract wealth at taxpayers' expense.'' and ``they have expanded the pool of capital available for transactions that monetize real property and turn it into tradable assets---financial widgets with little or no connection to the real purpose of the productive enterprises that occupy the properties they own.''

\section{Summary} 
Financialization of the housing market is the increasing control of the stock of urban land and housing by investors in order to capture the scarcity rent generated by the people of the city, and the system level effects of that increasing control.  In this chapter, we've discussed what this means at the level of finance and the development of particular financial and legal instruments, at the micro-economic level as these instruments are taken up, and we've introduced some of the broader macro system effects of this process of financialization. The rest of the dissertation is a further exploration of the systemic effects of this process.

% INTRO DEFN ALIGHN ''Financialization of the housing market refers to the growth in the share of the housing stock controlled by financial institutions and investors and the overall effect this has on the outcomes of the system \cite{farhaReportFinancializationHousing2017, hansenFinanceCapitalismFinancialization2014}. 


% ''Financialization is the process of capturing streams of surplus generated by society. The agglomeration processes that creates cities produces a growing stream of surplus and some of it appears as locational rents. Fianncialization of the housing market is the process capturing a larger share of urban locational rents. 

% Financialization is a process of capturing rents. It can be understood as a social innovation..

 
% There are three components

% there's the invention, the adoption,and the set of systems impacts.


% The analogy with digitization is worth extending.
% Can be understood as analagous to digitization. 
% ***E %tHIS PARAGRAPH IS AWKWARD TO READ
% In the development of information technology, there are particular technologies, which are developed and refined. For instance the transistor. Basically a logic switch. There is nothing new about a switch but they can be made so small they can be combined together into devices, calculators and eventually mainframe computers that research institutes purchased. The one at the Davis Center filled a whole floor, people wrote whole programs
% and there's this painstaiking phase, teaching the computer what people knew.
% The series of devices, mainframes, then personal computers, then phones miniaturization made computing ubiquitous.

% ADD BACK As with digitization of the economy, any single act, the adoption of one computer, had little effect. People find an action that can be profitable, see a local opportunity, replace one mechanical calculator with a digital calculator, but the collective effect was large.  There are many system level impacts: banks lay off half their workers, the devices can talk to each other, connect vast data sets, etc. 
% may be large
% At the individual action It's morally neutral as well.
%individuals can create what would have taken a publication studio, a film studio, 3D print, can bank from home. ..system level they can talk phases..

% For finncialization aim to capture flows of the surplus. legal and financial isntruments to do it. banks-- investmetn fuels it..
