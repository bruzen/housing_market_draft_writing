Financialization is the capture of streams of surplus generated by society by financial actors. It can happen in any market. This thesis is a study of the financialization of the housing market, particularly the system level effects of financialization on distribution and urban productivity. 

Financialization operates at different scales. In the following sections, we discuss financialization at the level of finance, microeconomics, and the larger system: the development of particular financial and legal instruments, the growth in the number of individual transactions that create or transfer financial assets, and the set of system-level set of shifts resulting from this process. 

\section{Instruments of financialization }
Financialization is achieved through the development of legal and financial instruments. 
These instruments become the building blocks enabling the process of financialization. We can think about financialization as something like the process of \gls{digitization}. 
Through the late 20th century to the present, activities have increasingly shifted from being analog or something humans do, to being done on digital devices. This process of digitization occurs across multiple scales. %has three phases/steps. 
% First the technologies must develop, 
% We talk about three aspects of financialization which occur in relation with one another, on different scales. These aspects are analogous to three aspects of digitization. 
First there's the development of technologies, ranging from  transistors, integrated circuits, and the wide array of products built from them including mainframe computers, laptops, and smartphones.  Second, there's a process of adoption, where these technologies are taken up. %In the case of say smartphones, this looks like ...
And finally there are the system level effects. % For example - digitization ...

In Financialization, legal and financial instruments are like the products that enabled the digitization of a increasingly wide range of activities. % over time: % that make digitization possible: 
% The second aspect is like ... The third aspect is like ...
This thesis is concerned with the third phase, but for context we must first understand the whole process, beginning with the financial tools. 

% One aspect of financialization is the development of the mechanisms of financialization.
To financialize something requires a \gls{financial instrument}, with two primary features: first it that represents something of value, and second, it can be bought and sold as an investment. These instruments, thus, capture of streams of surplus, converting them to financial assets that can be traded easily. 

There are numerous kinds of legal and financial instruments in the housing market and in the broader financial system. 
% Examples of financialization outside the housing system include stocks and stock markets, within the housing system, mortgages, and more recently Real Estate Investment Trusts.
% Stocks and mutual funds illustrate the core features of financial instruments. The \gls{joint-stock company}, the basis of the modern stock market and an important mechanism for channeling investment into productive activity, is probably the most important financial instrument in the capitalist economy. Stock markets are a primary means of mobilizing long-term savings and investment for fixed capital formation \cite{azfarMarketMobilizedCapital2003}. Originally a tool to allow a group of investors to pool their money, take on large projects, and to share risks, the stocks themselves rapidly became objects of trade and speculation, and there is substantial disagreement about the link between stock investment and investment in productive real assets.\footnote{Mork et al. \cite{morckStockMarketInvestment1990} identify four theories that attempt to explain the correlation between stock returns and subsequent investment. \begin{quotation}The first says that the stock market is a passive predictor of future activity that managers do not rely on to make investment decisions. The second theory says that, in making investment decisions, managers rely on the stock market as a source of information, which may or may not be correct about future fundamentals. The third theory, which is perhaps the most common view of the stock markets influence, says that the stock market affects investment through its influence on the cost of funds and external financing. Finally, the fourth theory says that the stock market exerts pressure on investment quite aside from its informational and financing role, because managers have to cater to investors' opinions in order to protect their livelihood. For example, a low stock price may increase the probability of a takeover or a forced removal of top management. If the market is pessimistic about the firm's profitability, top management may be deterred from investing heavily by the prospect of further erosion in the stock price.\end{quotation} None of the point to a direct connection between stock market investment and real investment.} % Share prices on the stock market are not tightly tied to the productivity of the company they represent, illustrating how the financial instrument can diverge from the real asset, and making it clear that the financial instrument is something different from the real asset. % Stock transactions can also be speculative. Most stock transactions are speculative in nature 
% Financial instruments can be combined and new types of instruments built on top of them. For example, mutual funds, which pool more risky stocks, in an effort to offer more reliable returns, are a financial instrument built on top of the stock market.

Financial instruments have been central to the housing system for a long time. One foundational financial instrument that changed the structure of the housing market is the mortgage. The mortgage demonstrates the two primary features of financial instruments. It is both a financial instrument that enables purchase and a financial asset that can be bought and sold. 

Mortgages allow lenders to participate in housing purchases in the present in exchange for a future flow of payments. The mortgage does not create housing, however it enables the prospective buyer to become the nominal owner of an asset that produces a stream of benefits. Because the stream of benefits from secure housing near a source of income generally exceeds a buyer's current assets, the mortgage enables the transfer of ownership by making it possible to transfer the rights to a substantial fraction of the future income of the buyer or mortgagee to the mortgage holder. In effect, the mortgage holder remains the property owner until the terms of the mortgage are fulfilled.  If the mortgagee fails to make those payments, the mortgage holder will repossess the asset. The security provided by this instrument ``de-risks'' the transaction, making it safer and therefore easier to achieve the mutual benefits of the sale.




Mortgages are financial instruments, but 
the additional step of trading these mortgages on a market is required to create a financialized market. 
Originally mortgages were an arrangement between just the buyer and the seller, but in the 1870s in the USA, insurance companies stepped into these transactions, paying off the seller and then collecting the principle and interest payments on behalf of the bank's shareholders. This innovation was an example of financialization that made it possible for individual insurance companies to profit by providing money to buyers. When mortgage lending was regulated and insured  by the American government during and after the great depression it facilitated a massive increase in home ownership in the USA and contributed to the post-war construction boom and the suburbanization of American cities. 

The housing market was thus financialized by the market for insurance backed mortgages, but these mortgages were still agreements between individual lenders and buyers. When financial institutions later developed markets that let them buy and sell bundles of mortgages among themselves, we say the mortgage market itself was financialized. There was then a further layer of financialization added ***E ADD in DATE, when a market for the promises to pay was established, in addition to the market for housing financed by % and the market for 
mortgage-type loans. ***E CLARIFY THIS SENTENCE. EXPLAIN THE MARKET FOR PROMISES TO PAY

The transactions in this market, for promises to pay, do not directly affect the mortgage conditions or the home. They simply add a new product for investors or banks to buy and sell. This new market was thought to further reduce the risk for lenders, but between 2007 and 2010 in the USA the sub-prime mortgage crisis destabilized the financial institutions that were playing this new market.\footnote{Arguably, that crisis resulted from overselling risky and predatory mortgages by lenders with more money to lend than the market could absorb. Eager investors seeking higher or more secure returns were willing  to buy bundles of  mortgages that were in theory de-risked. Pooling uncorrelated individual risk, as the insurance industry does, produces lower overall risk. (The instruments that enabled the speculative bubble were mortgage-backed securities (MBSes) and collateralized debt obligations (CDOs).) Pooling does not reduce systemic risk, however. As it turned out, the mortgage default rate rose, lenders' liquidity fell, mortgage rates were pushed up, defaults increased, and the market for the new instruments collapsed, taking down major financial institutions, providing a cautionary tale about potential costs of financialization.} % While the details don't matter for this thesis, they provide a cautionary tale about the the potential costs of financialization.}.  

Mortgages are clearly, financial instruments, but not all financial instruments are instruments of financialization. If financialization is the increase in the share of surpluses claimed by investors, and financialized owners, mortgages can do that, allowing some to invest in and claim a disproportinate share of future urban productivity. They may also function to transfer ownership of property to at least some individual community members, perhaps transferring the asset from the financial interests which funded development, to local distributed ownership, by community members primarily concerned with the use value of living in the house. This not only localizes distributes ownership of the stream of surpluses, and potentially acts to decouple it from larger financial interests and cycles.

\subsubsection{Investment trusts}
% Whats new in housing is not simply 
% characterized, allow vastly more inflow of finance into housing markets. 
% Mortgages have been around a long time, however, 
The process of financialization has involved the development of new financial instruments, suited to fianancialized ownership of housing. An example of a financial instrument designed specifically to support rent extraction and which increases the degree of financialization of the housing supply is the Real Estate Investment Trust (\gls{REIT}). A REIT is a company that owns, operates, or finances income-generating real estate and distribute the income to shareholders. While the company itself is an management system, the shares are are simply financial assets that are that are sold to individuals and organizations that want to share in real estate revenues and capital gains. There are other large owners of residential real estate such as life insurance companies and pension plans that behave similarly, but REITs are a relatively new financial instrument which is  expanding rapidly and attracting political attention for their effect on housing markets.  % REITs that develop new properties generally don't sell the properties they construct.

Developed in the USA  in 1960 (as an amendment to the Cigar Excise Tax Extension!) and in Canada in 1993 \cite{GET_REITsDevelopedDates}, REITs are similar to mutual funds in making it possible for an individual, often small investors to earn dividends from real estate investments without having to buy, manage, or finance any properties themselves. 

REITs have become increasingly popular in recent years. An S\&P-Dow Jones research bulletin reported that over the  25 years to 2017, REITs outperformed stocks, bonds, and commodities \cite{GET-Dow-Jones-research-bulletin}. Because they have outperformed competing investments they have attracted  capital from other uses, particularly during the recent period of low interest rates.\footnote{There are questions about preferential tax treatment, and whether some REITs are essentially inappropriately sheltered real-estate corporations.} For the purpose of this thesis, REITs are simply one of the mechanisms for the financialization of housing.

We have called attention in this section to the development of several important financial instruments---stocks, stock markets, derivatives, mortgages, and REITs---with the intention of  disentangling the concept of financial instruments from the term ``financialization.'' The development of instruments facilitates the process of financialization. It is not, in itself, financialization, however.

\section{Adoption: transactions and market share}

Financialization is the capture of the streams of surplus from society. Financialization thus requires not just the existence of instruments of financialization, but that someone takes up these instruments, capturing streams of surplus. 


% financialization requires 
%these instrumetns are adopted. % that there is a market, and a process of adoption, 
  % This has various functions at a systems level, adding liquidity, etc..
% At the microeconomic level,  a second aspect of financialization is as 
% In this sense, 
At the microeconomic level, then, financialization  is occurring if there is an increase in the stock of financial assets associated with a stock of some set of real assets. This is why the term is often used as a collective noun for the growth in the number and/or size of  transactions, creating or transferring financial assets \cite{GET_financialization-numberOfTransactions}. These transactions typically occur through a \gls{market}.

% The word also refers the the take up, the adoption as well. % It is the innovation not just the invention.
% it is also the increasingly control derived from the development of these kinds of mechanism. 
% Financialization of the economy is not new

While there is not a single point at which financialization began, Thomson and Dutta,  \cite{thomsonFinancialisationPrimer2018}, suggest that 15 August 1971, when President Richard Nixon announced that the United States would unpeg the dollar from gold, marks a turning point in the financialization of the economy. The accelerated growth in global liquidity and prompted a surge of financial liberalisation and deregulation and undermined the Bretton Woods System.  Synthetic derivatives were created soon after: The Chicago Mercantile Exchange launched futures contracts written on financial instruments the following year and the Chicago Board of Trade introduced the first interest rate future contracts three years later. Arbitrage, options trading, and various other activities grew exponentially. By 2011, the over-the-counter (OTC) and exchange-traded derivatives market amounted to almost \$800 trillion.  %**MAKE MORE CLER WHAT THESE THINGS MEAN.

\section{Instruments of financialization}
This process of financializaiton has been enabled through particular instruments of financialization.

\section{Systems change}
% \section{Financialization as an emergent property}
At the macro level at the system level, financialization is an emergent and transformative feature of the economy, rather like digitization. Digitization, like financialization, represents a fundamental  system  change. It was not and is not a planned process, but rather the result of millions of individual decisions, each in pursuit of specific, local, individual goals, and ideas about what is happening in the system.  As with financialization, the pursuit of these goals supported the development of new supply chains and institutions, and %.  As with  financialization, 
the cumulative effect was systematic change. 

A third aspect of the word financialization is these system level effects of financialization. Thomas Palley describes financialization as ``a process whereby financial markets, financial institutions, and financial elites gain greater influence over economic policy and economic outcomes. Financialization transforms the functioning of economic systems at both the macro and micro levels'' \cite{palleyFinancializationWhatIt2007}. 

% There are different kinds of systemic effects of this kind of increasing control and coupling could have/appear to have ELABORATE
There are many systems effects. ADD MORE %Jammison goes further and argues that the material and economic relations can actually structure our relation to society and ourselves, and even the ability to solve problems (e.g. methaprical structures limit ability to deal with societal crises like climate change).
We focus on the distributional effects, and hysteresis.
To illustrate the potential for systemic shifts, we describe some of the system level effects of the widespread adoption of instruments for the financialization of housing introduced earlier, mortgages and REITs. 
% This process of financialization also has profound impact at systems level. 
% And the word financialization, at the macro level, refers to this set of impacts.
% THOUGHT TO LOWER RISK  %DID THE CRISIS SHOW IT DIDN'T?
% The instruments and share are not neutral tools. They have the potential to have a profound effect at the level of the system.

Mortgages can influence the system in a number of ways. %When we consider urban housing, 
A mortgage is the right to future income generated by capital, labour, and the city itself through the agglomeration effects that drive productivity. It is an instrument that indirectly captures a share of the urban rents. As productivity rises, wages rise, rents rise, property prices rise and mortgages rise. \textbf{The effect is ADD}

REITs also have system level effects. %are not a neutral tool for saving either. 
According to a paper \cite{wangAnalyzeImpactREITs2021} on REITS in the Irish housing market, ``REIT successfully reconnected the international financial market and the Irish real estate market.'' In other words, in Ireland, REITs have made it easier for international capital to buy Irish land. The entry of outside and footloose capital has had an effect on the resident population:  ``the large-scale acquisition of Irish real estate by REITs and other real estate buyers has also caused some new problems. First, the active management of assets by REITs and other investors has led to a rapid increase in rents.''\footnote{In  IMF working paper ``Capital Account Liberalization and Inequality'' \cite{furceriCapitalAccountLiberalization2015}  Furceri and Loungani reported that that for 149 countries from 1970 to 2010, ``after countries take steps to open their capital account, an increase in inequality in incomes within countries follows.'' The observation is consistent with our argument  that domestic \gls{rent-seeking} in housing markets will increase inequality.}  

There is evidence that REITs affect real estate markets in other ways. Bat et all  \cite{batRolePublicREITs2022} repoRt that  ``they are actually financial actors that aggressively buy up property assets and manage them to extract wealth at taxpayers’ expense. '' and ``they have expanded the pool of capital available for transactions that monetize real property and turn it into tradable assets---financial widgets with little or no connection to the real purpose of the productive enterprises that occupy the properties they own.''
