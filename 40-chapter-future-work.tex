TODO PUT THIS INTO THE BODY OF THE TEXT BEFORE CONCLUSION?

% In  this chapter, we discuss potential extensions of our basic model. 
Our goal has been to make a simple model that illustrates essential principles like the % model as simple as the 
Alonzo model \cite{alonsoLocationLandUse1964}. We have sharply restricted our model  in order to focus on one process of significance, financialization.  %This is in part so that we can explain and justify each assumption that we use, and in part because building from sharply restricted helps to create understandable results.  
% Those results are condition on the specific set of assumptions to ensure that 
We have nevertheless designed the model to accommodate a range of extensions to explore questions that are theoretically or interesting or important for policy-makers. 
In this chapter, we explain the choices for what is included and excluded from the model and then describe potential extensions.




\section{Extensions}
There are several illustrative classes of extension. Figure~\ref{fig-extensions-logic} illustrates five general types of extension to the base model.  In each case, we introduce the class and give several examples. 

The first is to move from a static population to a model with population pressure. % This appears on the left as a group of three new subroutines with connections to the elements of the model most directly affected. % Some links are left out to keep the figure readable. Examples of omitted links  are the channels through which  population affects labour supply and savings.  

A second class of extension would introduce a housing production sector. This appears on the right side of of the figure linked to the banking sector. It requires adding a dynamic housing stock. 

A third major class of extensions, separable from production is to introduce variation of housing form,  density and amenity. Zoning restrictions and building codes are related. Many questions about who gets what housing arise at this point.

\end{figure}}


At the bottom of the figure we introduce a fourth class of intervention, consumer demand linked to the population structure and feeding back to growth. Savings behaviour becomes more  complex when consumer demand is made endogenous and with as more complex population structure.

The fifth block of extensions illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig-extensions-logic} would replace the simple, scaling-based transmission mechanism in the Alonso-Jacobs cycle with explicit firm and labour market behaviour. This class of extensions is obviously linked to population structure. It leads to consideration of firms that produce different products, some for export some for the local market, and to multiple types of labour.

Linked to the labour market and production system is the possibility of introducing competing cities. 

% It should be clear that e
Each extension is potentially as complex as the core model, and each introduces additional assumptions. 
%We would argue that none of them would change our qualitative results greatly, although each would deepen our understanding of mechanisms and of the detailed impacts.

There are many more possible models than this, and these extensions combine. Models are by nature combinatoric: every added element involves making a choice among alternative assumptions and implementations. A model incorporating in binary choices is one of an implicit family of $2^n$ alternative models. 
They also describe a particular logic, which may be explored or studied in any particular region or context, drawing on local data and estimated parameter values. The context will also suggest, in many cases theoretical extensions, or particular questions.

\section{Population pressure} 
Our basic model does not have a growing population. This conveniently allows us to isolate certain effects of financialization. Population pressure is one of the drivers of financialization because it amplifies speculative gains, however. As a result, one of the first extensions must be  to introduce population pressure.

There are two sources to consider: 
\begin{enumerate}
\item agglomeration effects that increase the wage and attract workers faster than the housing stock can respond. 

Worker agents from outside the city can always consider moving and accepting a job. 
% QUESTION - how to manage the flow of new agents?
%, or can make more from rents and moving away
\item immigration pressure
\end{enumerate}
under the  first, agglomeration economies drive population while under the second, population growth may drive agglomeration.

The growth of the housing stock will generally lag population growth, generating price effects and stock dynamics.

Agents will respond to increases in demand conditions. The perception that the market is tight or that prices are rising may lead to higher bids and reservation prices and shift results in favour of sellers.  


%Buyers could consider neighbourhood pressures, demographic changes, changes in job location, desire for amenity etc. in their assessment of housing need. 

%With multiple bids agents can place the most competitive bids on those homes they prefer. If they have higher urgency they place strong bids on more homes. 

%Next buyers request a selection of homes to consider from a real estate agent. Those with higher need for housing look at more homes. The real estate agent offers a selection of homes based on the agent's requirements. A randomness parameter determines how many divergent houses are also considered. When the parameter is 1, the selection of homes is fully randomized, When it is 0, the agent sorts all available homes and offers those which fit the agents budget, space, and other requirements best.

\subsection{Retirement investors and private investment properties}
The simple population turnover in our model can be replaced with a more complex set of possibilities at the agent level.  At retirement,  agents can be allowed to may choose between selling their home, renting it as an income property, or if there is sufficient amenity value for them, staying in the city. Implementing these choices complicates the agent decision and the resulting housing distribution but require few changes to the rest of the model.

\section{Housing production}

\section{Differences in density, housing form, and neighbourhood amenity}
Much of what is interesting in a city is the rich variety of housing forms and neighbourhoods and the varied populations that occupy them. Our model has a single form of housing and an undifferentiated populations, allowing us to differentiate the housing system in specific ways and study the interactions between the built world and the population. We are convinced that few of the possible extensions could affect our qualitative results. 

Nonetheless, in our agent based model, in which every lot is  addressable, it is simple to introduce zoning boundaries, local amenities, different densities or housing qualities and homes of different sizes. Hundreds of experiments are possible exploiting  the extensibility we have carefully conserved.  

We can ask what would be the effect of a hard zoning boundary and what would be the effect of suddenly relaxing it. We could explore the effect of speeding the rate of conversions from one size  home to another, or of locating high density pocket on a transportation route. Many significant urban policy questions could be examined with a limited amount of additional programming. 

\section{The consumer city}
Much of the demand for what is produced in the city is local consumer demand.  Our model has assumed there is production only for a perfectly elastic export demand. Consumer needs are buried in the subsistence wage. 

A minimal extension would be to introduce a second sector representing local consumption demand. A share of locally generated income would support production for the city's population. The labour force would be split between the two sectors and both productivity and wages might differ across sectors. 

A more complex treatment would introduce a range of service, entertainment and retail producers. This might be done monopolistically competitive firms \'a la Dixit and Stiglitz \cite{AvinashK.Dixit1977MCaO}.



\subsection{Distribution of rents}
Rents go to landowners, with a share taken for maintenance and taxes.
Rents may also be taxed, could be shared between multiple owners, etc.
 %\note{REPHRASE? rent is  extracted from the coalition of capital and workers.} % Rents may also be taxed, could be shared between multiple owners, etc. 
%The rents are captured by landowners.  The capture of rents by landowners is common buy not necessary. 
In principle the gains from urban productivity and amenity can be allocated as social wealth through shared ownership, as is often done on a small scale with cooperatives and land trusts, distributed to all citizens through something like a social wealth fund, or captured in taxes or fees as Henry George suggested. 
%The rents would otherwise go to labour and capital.





\subsection{Urban Savings - Contributions?}
THIS IS A CONTRIBUTION, BUT ALSO A DISCUSSION OF ONE WAY THIS WORK COULD BE EXTENDED, MIXED WITH A BIT OF MODEL DESCRIPTION

Conventional growth models specify a savings/investment mechanism at the national level. To our knowledge, this has not been done for the city level. We require  savings at two levels. First, since we want to incorporate  households home ownership and a relationship to the financial sector through mortgages, We specify a savings rate out of the spending we have isolated in the `subsistence wage' This means that both urban and rural workers accumulate savings, that savings are age-dependent, making the size of mortgage available also age dependent. 

Homeowners in addition have equity $E=P-M$ in their homes.  ({\color{red}Should newcomers also have equity? or is it built into the savings. Clarify this.} 

A second level of saving is the  investment in capital out of the city surplus. Even raising this question puts us into terra incognita. There are many  channels through which surplus flows into productive investment in the urban contest. One is through public investment in infrastructure. We have discussed how falling transportation costs increase surplus generation. Investments like this are made slowly and take effect over time periods much longer than our model is concerned with.  We can set a property tax rate   that we will assume is sufficient to maintain the stock of infrastructure.

Public and private investment in human capital is largely urban as well, but as with infrastructure, investment and response take effect over time periods much longer than our model is concerned with. 

Private sector innovation in technology, marketing, or products draws on local saving less but still significantly on local savings. We have little in the way of theory or empirical research on this channel. Lags between investment and any rise in the urban wage premium are almost certainly long and variable. 

We deal with this issue by linking local capital ownership with the scale factor. It is known that local ownership is associated with local investment. We will assume that local capital ownership, which consists in part of local ownership of the housing stock, can be proxied by homeowner equity as a share of local. 

\subsubsection{Savings and retirement behaviour}
Agents fund their retirement from savings, as well as returns on their home if they have one to sell. Savings may be invested in a pension fund, or in local property,  depending on expected risks and returns. In the real world, financial institution manages most pensions, investing in the market or in property.  All this institutional structure is probably most easily handled by implementing a savings account for each agent. We are not interested in the detailed investment behavour for the financial sector.% either in the stock market, or in pensions.

%Institutional and individual investors can access debt. %

We could also consider a case where outside money can come under institutional management, not just local retirement savings. A parameter would control the inflow of additional money beyond local investment in the pension fund. 



\section{Making  labour market and firm behaviour explicit }
We have carefully developed the link between neoclassical growth theory and the literature on urban scaling \cite{bettencourtIntroductionUrbanScience2021} and  We then imposed the scaling result on our model.  We force the model to conform to the empirical data on the relationship between population and productivity. This amounts to black-boxing the entire production and labour demand sector as well as the construction and housing production sector. 

This made sense because our focus  was on the housing market and the financial sector, but the model we have constructed will allow us to ``fill the black box'' with more complete models of the production and labour market to see how they compare to the empirical data. 

The  scaling  literature also provides relationships between density and population and infrastructure cost and population that we can explore in the same way.

In the scaling literature, these relationships are increasingly theorized in terms of network effects, which is perfectly consistent with the Jacobs analysis and the more recent neoclassical growth modeling.


\subsection{MOVE TO TRANSMISSION CHAPTER? The transmission puzzle}

The transmission of productivity increases arising from agglomeration effects  to the urban wage through firms, can be modelled in many ways. The agglomeration effects are external to the firm and therefore likely to be unexpected. If  firms underestimate the marginal product of labour, labour productivity will be greater than expected, output will be higher than planned output, and revenue and profits will therefore be higher than expected. Excess demand will attract more productive capital which in turn will demand more labour,  Rising labour demand drives up the wage. The agglomeration effect driving growth is essentially a public good in which individual firms will under-invest. This raises a policy challenge that we leave for others. CLARIFY - ALSO STILL A FOOTNOTE IN MODEL SECTION. CUT OR REF THEiR IF MOVING HERE.

 It is straightforward to compute the rate of excess return for  this model. 


\begin{figure}
\centering
\input{fig/multiple-marginal-products}
\caption{Multiple marginal products.}
\label{fig-multiple-marginal-products}
\end{figure}



Figure~\ref{fig-marginal-products} illustrates the problem. We can  make a distinction between the myopic marginal productivity curve observed  at the shop floor level and  the firm-wide effect of adding a worker. The red curve labeled ``Myopic'' represents the declining direct marginal productivity of labour as  might be observed by a shop manager, who could report how much more output one with one worker one lathe would produce. The blue line above it labeled ``Firm-wide'' represents the actual effect on firm productivity that arises because the new worker makes other workers in the firm more productive. This addition to output would be observable for managers reviewing the firm's performance over time. It might be most easily observed in small firms. 

We can go on to consider the slower and distributed effect on closely related firms, which would raise any estimate of marginal product.  If there are 10 other firms and a new worker  has a small spillover effect  $\epsilon$ on each,  the spillovers raise the industry  marginal product  by $10\epsilon$. Each of the  10 other firms  enjoys  an additional $10\epsilon$ gain in the marginal product of their workers. This should lead to additional hiring by other firms.

Finally, expanding our view another step, we notice that if each of the  10 other firms hires one worker who produces an additional  $10\epsilon$ gain in output for all firms, the total spillover effect would rise by $100\epsilon$. The social marginal product of a single hire is indicated by the green line. 



\section{The system of cities}
Modern cities are not lonely and autarkic  beasts wandering their own exclusive territory and unconnected to others of the species. Each is one in a global system of cities that compete and complement each other. Information, capital and even labour flows between cities are large. Henderson Abdel-Rahman\cite{Henderson1972Sizes}, Abdel-Rahman \cite{abdel-rahmanAgglomerationEconomiesTypes1990}, Fujita \cite{fujitaMonopolisticCompetitionModel1988}, Fujita, Krugman, and Venables \cite{fujitaSpatialEconomyCities1999}, and Fujita and Thiess \cite{fujitaEconomicsAgglomeration1996} among others provide models for expandingh the model in this direction.



\subsection{Taxes, municipal government, public goods, and productivity,}
This is a major issue with considerable development in the economics literature. Property taxes reduce the net locational value that flows to an individual owner but provides services and wages that make the city attractive. 

(create a regime where particular groups have an advantage)

Localized tax advantages can move a share of financialised investment into private consolidation of land.
including the structure of taxes for investment properties, institutional investors, individuals, etc.





\section{A possible typology of models and experiments}
While there  are many variations on the basic urban model and many potential experiments with each model there are only a few of immediate interest if the goal is to text the ``resilience'' of equilibria.

These models may exhibit irreversibilities in variables such as distribution, homelessness, city form, and class structure. 

The basic strategy for examining the system resilience is to shock a model (experiment) and then see if diagnostic variables recover. (This needs more precise expression.)

The first task is to select a subset of models an experiments that are of particular interests with respect to.

The second is to construct a model that allows those case to be examined. Ideally the model would be easily adapted to other experiments.

The following is a an attempt to develop a typology with a clear progressive structure.

Feedback - wealth allows upgrading. This advantages the rich. Maybe this 

\subsection{Models}
\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{A: The basic model}

The workhorse of urban economics is the circular city model. Some feature of the central place generates rents. It may be that it is the only employment centre. It may be economies of scale to a single activity or synergies arising from various externalities\footnote{We are interested in agglomeration economies. The wage  structure would then be related to the population or industry  structure. Externalities driving agglomeration may be classified  into two types, the  or so-called ``Marshalian''  and ``Jacobs'' externalities.}. 

In the simplest model, the central place pays a uniform wage, $w$ to all employees, who have identical preferences and transportation costs. $w$ is an attribute of individual residents. Residents  purchase or rent equal quantities of land at differing locations $l$ for identical housing.  

There are transportation costs $T$ that depend on distance from the  central place, so land close to the central place is more attractive than land farther from the central place.  

The equilibrium concept is that a market with identical individuals with identical incomes and transportation costs will result in identical utilities. The result is that land rent must decline with distance from the central place to offset rising transportation cost. 

The size of the city is determined by population and lot size. Income and transportation costs will interact with lot size. The basic model can be initialized by matching the number of properties to the size of the population. 

If population exceeds the number of properties there are three margins to consider
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item The land supply can increase. There may be a conversion cost
		\item The land per-capita may decrease. This is not simple in a city with land-use regulations, zoning, and fixed capital in homes. A conversion process has to be defined
		\item A homeless population can emerge. 
	\end{enumerate}

It is convenient in this model to use a \gls{Cobb-Douglas} utility function that has the property that a fixed fraction of income is spent on housing.  We can start with the assumption that earnings are fixed for the lifetime at the one-period wage, $w$. Then total spending on housing is $\beta Y, \beta <1$ and $ Y=w$. Let the transportation cost for a specific location $l$ be $T(l)$. The  equilibrium price at that location will be $P(l)= \beta Y-T(l)$.

It is convenient but not necessary to assume that land outside of the residential limit is costless. It is common to assume a fixed price for agricultural land. 

There is no fixed boundary and the size of the city is determined by the utility that can be achieved in competing regions of competing

\item \textbf{Y: The basic model with Income Differences}
This will result in segregation by neighbourhood depending on income. 

Income can be purely earning, which requires a distribution of $w$ across agents. Income  might include investment income, which  a private rate of return and a distribution of assets across agents. \footnote{A more subtle model could allow individual wages to be linked to the agglomeration of other workers - say engineers. we can imagine a city that has centres of agglomeration by profession or by complementarity. Depending on the production function, this should emerge endogenously.}
\footnote{Sufficient investment income could lead individuals to locate in cheap properties at the edge of the city.  Income might also be invested in property affecting the quality of a unit. This would require incorporating unit quality in the attribute list for each property, and introducing a quality preference  in the attribute s of residents.}

\item \textbf{L: The basic model with Locational Preferences}
This will result in segregation by neighbourhood depending on preferences.

One version would be include distance to the edge of the city as an amenity in the utility function. Another would be to locate amenities within the city. These would lead to higher prices near amenities.

A natural variant would be to have earning depend on location. If there were several locations  a polycentric city would emerge.

\item \textbf{T: The basic model with varied transportation cost }
This will result in segregation by neighbourhood depending on income and Transportation costs. Experiments include cars for the rich and  transit. 

Diagnostics include change in total transportation cost and differential welfare effects.

\item \textbf{R: The basic model with a rent-own choice}
This may result in the emergence of classes. Agents must have the capacity to borrow to purchase. Attributes of the agents and must now include  net assets,  an available interest rate, and a permissible mortgage.

We imagine a banker setting the mortgage rates and size. This can be done at the beginning of each period for each agent. 

With no income differential we expect equal utiliites

\item \textbf{YR: The basic model with earnings (Y) differences and a rent-own choice}
This model is likely to generate diverging classes as income differentials permit some to capture land rents from others. This is highly likely if borrowing costs decline with income and asset ownership.

\item \textbf{L: The basic model with variable lot size}
This is achieved by making lot size a choice variable for households, in which case we will get a trade off between transportation cost and lot size and distance. Results for this model are known. Density  falls with distance from the centre. 

\item \textbf{YL: The basic model with earnings (Y) differences and variable lot size}
The wealthy choose larger homes and lots farther form the centre

\item \textbf{S: The basic model with constant lot size and variable density}
This is achieved by allowing stacking of housing units. Results for this model are not known. This introduces a step change in housing form, and emphasizes unit size.

This model should produce some interesting spatial patterns, especially if couples with the possibility of secondary central places.

\item \textbf{YS: The basic model with earnings (Y) differences, constant lot size and variable density}

This model should produce some interesting spatial patterns, especially if couples with the possibility of secondary central places.

\item \textbf{IR: The basic model with outside investors and rent-own}

\item \textbf{IYR: The basic model with outside investors, earnings differentials and rent-own choice} This model is of interest if borrowing costs decline with income and asset ownership.
\end{enumerate}
\subsection{Experiments}
There are various experiments of interest. You will have to pick key ones. It is not necessary to do all of them in every model. 

	\begin{enumerate}
		\item increase population
		\item increase wage
		\item add hard boundary (limit land)
		\item Introduce differential incomes
		\item Introduce differential access to capital
	\end{enumerate}
