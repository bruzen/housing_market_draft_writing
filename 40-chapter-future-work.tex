% In  this chapter, we discuss potential extensions of our basic model. 
Our goal in this thesis has been to make a simple model that illustrates essential principles. % like the  the Alonzo model \cite{alonsoLocationLandUse1964}. 
We have sharply restricted our model in order to focus on one process of significance: financialization and its effects. However, with simple extensions, the model is capable of generating testable empirical hypotheses on a series of policy issues.

In this model, we have three distinct elements: 
\begin{enumerate}
    \item A model of the city/property market
    \item A model of firms/urban production and
    \item A model of the financial and institutional structure linking them, which defines who gets what share of the surplus through ownership, taxation, etc.
\end{enumerate}Each component is extensible, % is designed  to accommodate a range of extensions, 
and the model is modular enough that any given segment may be removed and replaced with another, perhaps more detailed, implementation of the sector.\footnote{The extensions detailed here also combine. Models are by nature combinatoric: every added element involves making a choice among alternative assumptions and implementations. Each extension is potentially as complex as the core model, and each introduces additional assumptions. A model incorporating in binary choices is one of an implicit family of $2^n$ alternative models.} 
In the following sections, we describe possible extensions to each of the three modules. % that open a set of interesting questions. 
In each case, we also introduce approaches for integrating data more systematically, or more thoroughly exploring the static and dynamic properties of the model. % detail several promising extensions to each module.


% \subsection{Combinatorial experiments}
% Extensions from this basic model can go in several directions. We treat three categories of extension to this model:
% There are many more possible models than this, and these extensions combine. 
% They also describe a particular logic, which may be explored or studied in any particular region or context, drawing on local data and estimated parameter values. The context will also suggest, in many cases additional theoretical extensions, or particular questions.
% we have designed the model to accommodate a range of extensions. This chapter discusses future work.
% We start with a discussion of the key questions we are most interested in pursuing in the near future. We then introduce other bodies of work this work could connect with. Finally, we describe the steps needed to build out the base structure of this work to increase the rigour and explanatory power of the model by adding extensions to the model, improving the analysis, and integrating the work with data.

% In many cases, the natural extension is connecting this work with other existing bodies of work or models.  In this chapter, we review what we have and then describe potential extensions in each area, along with several examples as well as hypotheses about what those extensions might produce. 

% We have nevertheless designed the model to accommodate a range of extensions to explore questions that are theoretically or interesting or important for policy-makers.

% We focus on extensions to this base model, and selected experiments that this model is well positioned to explore.  At the end of the chapter there is a brief discussion of directions for future work more broadly. Extensions may be to particular agents, whether residents, firms, investors, or land, or changes in the boundary, flow or connections with the larger system. Broader questions include the potential for understanding urban savings, or the effect of financialization as systems change that this work raises. % TODO Explain Figure~\ref{fig-extensions-logic}. % illustrates five general types of extension to the base model.  In each case, we introduce the class and give several examples.

%     \item there are no transaction costs

% The result is that land rent must decline with distance from the central place to offset rising transportation cost. The size of the city is determined by the wage, transportation cost and lot size. 
%Income and transportation costs will interact with lot size. 


% We look forward to relaxing many of the assumptions to allow us to explore additional questions.\footnote{We want to emphasize that, although our investigation has focused on financialization and one of the most important results is the potential importance of linkages between finacialization and productivity, we do not intend to undertake empirical research on those linkages. The empirical research is important, but it is not our field.}  

% Three of the most immediate and promising extensions involve adding attributes to agents.\footnote{In code, augmenting agents requires simple additions to agent descriptions.} Another group of three extensions add structural elements to the model. With the augmented agents from the first group of extensions, these structural extensions would accommodate a very large set of related projects.

\section{Extensions to model of housing market}
The base housing market model may be extended to introduce the study of production, varied density, amenity and locational preference, transportation costs, regulations, zoning, and the relationship of each city with the larger work and other cities. Each extension raises interesting questions related to the core issues of financialization.

\subsection{Housing production and density}

Financialization interacts with the production of housing because land acquisition and construction require financing and prospects for sales depend on the housing market which is affected by financialization.

% We can introduce a housing production sector. This extension appears on the right side of Figure~\ref{fig-extensions-logic} linked to the banking sector. 
Introducing a housing production sector requires adding a dynamic housing stock, either directly in the equations or explicitly by modelling the actions of agents acquiring and developing land. % to subdivide and develop. 
 An explicit agent model would describe the classes of agents involved in housing production such as land assemblers, construction companies, developers. 
Financing developments involves financial institutions and financial instruments. Decisions are made on the basis of relatively long term forecasts and the housing production system is likely to exhibit strong lags with the potential to produce cyclic behaviour.

% Financialization of the housing market %is a flow of money into the housing market but not into housing production, 
% Financialization is not expansion of the housing stock, it is transfer of ownership. It is a process logically orthogonal to development, as we try to illustrate with Figure~\ref{fig-financialization-expansion}. It may however interact with the production of housing because land acquisition and construction require financing and prospects for sales depend on the housing market which is affected by financialization. 
% Introducing a housing production sector with land developers and home construction is a larger task. 
% Considerable work is underway among collaborators at Waterloo, raising the possibility of productive synergies.



% \subsection{Housing density}
Cities also contain a rich variety of housing forms and neighbourhoods and the varied populations that occupy them. Separable from production, it is possible, is to introduce variation of housing form and density.  % Many questions about who gets what housing arise at this point. 
% Consider adding density, to look at how it interacts with agglomeration effects.
%Introducing housing density variation. As with amenities, density variation density requires us to add attributes to locations and preference structures to individuals. 
% As with amenities we expect sorting by income and preference in this case as well but density is an urban attribute that is important for many reasons, not least because affects population and is therefore going to interact with productivity, and be amplified through the Alonso-Jacobs feedback loop.     
% Much of what is interesting in a city is the 
 %Our model has a single form of housing and an undifferentiated populations, allowing us to differentiate the housing system in specific ways and study the interactions between the built world and the population.

% Variable density is achieved by allowing stacking of housing units. % Results for this model are not known. This introduces a step change in housing form, and emphasizes unit size. Variable lot size is achieved by making lot size a choice variable for households, in which case we will get a trade off between transportation cost and lot size and distance. Results for this model are known. Density falls with distance from the centre. 

% \subsection{Locational preferences}

\subsection{Amenity and locational preferences}
In our base model, an urban wage premium is the only labour attractor. Effectively, we have set the level of amenities to zero to focus on the productivity effects. In reality, buying a home is always the purchase of a bundle of characteristics such as location, building space, yard, local density and local \glsdisp{amenity}{amenities}. Stegman found that ``a large majority of families who have recently moved to the suburbs are more concerned with neighborhood quality than with accessibility to other parts of the metropolitan region.'' Importantly, 
``There is evidence that the amenities offered by a city enhance its growth'' \cite{clarkAmenitiesDriveUrban2002, falckPhantomOperaCultural2011} and that amenity effects themselves scale superlinearly \cite{kraemerCulturalSustainabilityUS2022}.
% We would like to differentiate neighbourhoods by amenity level and differentiate the population by wealth and income. Sorting by wealth and income is the expected result, but our model will allow us to  see if financialization affects the sort and whether public policies can have positive effects. 
Appendix~\ref{chapter-amenity} discusses amenities in more detail. 

Introducing differences in amenity involves adding attributes and preferences to agents about they prefer their housing to be close to.  One version would be to include distance to the edge of the city as an amenity in resident's utility function. Another would be to locate amenities within the city. These would lead to higher prices near amenities. A third variant would be to have earning depend on location. If there were several locations a polycentric city would emerge. Locational preferences may result in segregation by neighbourhood depending on preferences.



\subsection{Transportation costs} % and the evolution of the city} \label{section-transportation}
Another spatial feature that could be explicitly modeled is %that can be greatly filled in in the model, is 
the transportation cost. Transportation costs to the urban center determine land values. % Wage and transportation cost determine the radius of the circular city, which determines the size of the labour force which affects urban productivity. The cost of travel is therefore an important variable in the development of urban productivity. 
% The transportation cost/distance relationship appears to be non-linear in many cases. While the linear model connects with the established literature, we likely want to explore the implications of more empirically grounded curve (e.g. \cite{bertaudSpatialDistributionPopulation2003}).
Varied transportation costs based on location and mode of transportation will result in segregation by neighbourhood depending on income and transportation costs. 

%Experiments include cars for those who can afford them overlapping with transit. % Diagnostics include change in total transportation cost and differential welfare effects.
% Urban transportation is primarily a municipal responsibility and major component of the municipal budget. Private transportation costs can be affected by municipal planning, construction, and regulation. Transportation costs are therefore a policy variable.  A decline in private transport costs results in an increase in the social surplus generated by the city. One feature of interest when we examine financialization is whether the surplus generate by investment in the transportation system goes to residents, firm owners, the public sector or to financial capital. 
% The problem is to determine to whom it goes. 
% Transportation costs are not likely to be affected appreciably nor quickly by the financialization of housing, so we have implemented a simple, uniform transport cost in our basic model. 
The theory implies that transportation improvements that reduce the cost of travelling to work should affect rents, but there may be spillover effects or leakage into wages  at the centre. %or allow for city expansion at the edge.   
% To see how, consider an expenditure that decreases transport costs.  A simple version of the urban economic theory  that underlies our  model can be summarized by the equation that for each household, rent plus transportation costs add up to a constant \cite{sootTransportationCostsUrban1974c}.\footnote{The formula assumes that access to work is the only goal of transportation for households, that there is a single mode of transport available and that households are able to minimize the sum of rent and transport costs. None of these are strictly true, and cannot relied on for a fine-grained analysis of the city, but are very convenient for our purposes.} % We have however, given some thought to how to introduce transportation costs into a model if it is applied to planning issues. 
The degree of spillover will likely be sensitive to the relative elasticities of demand and supply  for labour, land, consumption, and local densities. These leakages may reduce the amount of the social gain captured as land rent. % Without building in elasticities we cannot make predictions for specific cities or situations. % We  have not built the elasticities into our model so we 
 %We know, however, that who gets the rents in determined by the degree of financial ownership of  the housing stock. This we can and will explore. 

% We can derive qualitative results. For example, if reducing transportation costs make more land economically available for city expansion, increased supply should reduce land rents at the centre and increase labour supply, reduce wages and increase output.  But what if land is not cheap at the edge of the city and density cannot adjust? The city cannot grow. The decrease in transportation cost will increase the effective wage, and will have a bigger effect the farther a household resides from the centre. ($\partial{\omega-cd}{c}>0$) and rents in the periphery will rise. With a fixed population they should therefore fall at the centre. But the locational rent at the centre is equal to the wage premium, so there should also be downward pressure on the wage, but not labour costs, making labour more available for the same wage premium. The effect on rents land rents may vary. If transportation cost keeps falling and lots of land is available, then you don't get strong increases in land prices. If there are strong differentials, that gives the class result in the city, but doesn't tell you how it would affect it. 

\subsection{Regulation and zoning}
Economic dictates and building codes and master plans regulate which land is developed at what density and when. In future work, we could model the effects of rules. For example, we could explore the effects of a hard zoning boundary and the effects of relaxing it. We could also explore the effect of speeding the rate of conversions from one size  home to another, or of locating high density pocket on a transportation route. By adding rules like these, many significant urban policy questions could be examined with a limited amount of additional programming. 
% Zoning restrictions and building codes are related.


\subsection{Systems of cities}
%
Modern cities are not lonely and autarkic beasts wandering their own exclusive territory. Each city is one in a global system of cities that compete with and complement each other. 
There are important questions to explore when the city is one city among others, but, as DiBartholemeo and Turnbull \cite{dibartolomeoClosedVsOpen2023} point out,``[t]he empirical literature examining the determinants of city size almost exclusively uses the closed city version of the Millsâ€“Muth model,''\footnote{Our model is intermediate in the sense that it allows for labour flows  between city and countrysides, but not between cities.} 
%Labour and capital mobility matters. 
However, flows of information, capital and even labour between cities are substantial and matter in the long run. With free movement, policies in one city will affect outcomes in other cities. Henderson Abdel-Rahman \cite{Henderson1972Sizes}, Abdel-Rahman \cite{abdel-rahmanAgglomerationEconomiesTypes1990}, Fujita \cite{fujitaMonopolisticCompetitionModel1988}, Fujita, Krugman, and Venables \cite{fujitaSpatialEconomyCities1999}, and Fujita and Thiess \cite{fujitaEconomicsAgglomeration1996} among others provide approaches for expanding the model in this direction.  %We would like to examine how the city connects with the larger system of cities.  The issues that arise resemble the issues that are made explicitly by  macroeconomic distinction between open and closed economies at the national level.\cite{hendersonSystemsCitiesClosed1982, dibartolomeoUrbanSprawlClosed2021}. % and unconnected to others of the species. 

At the cost of additional computational complexity, the simple circular city can be extended to to produce other forms, including polycentric cities and hierarchies of cities. Embedding the city in a system of cities makes it possible to explore questions such as: % will let us  explore a number of important questions. 
\begin{enumerate}
\item How does the city connect with the larger system of cities and does a dominant city emerge? 
\item To what extent will we see specialization? 
\item When are systems of cities stable? 
\end{enumerate}
To explore these and other questions we would simply clone the model and connect the clones with population flows that respond to local variables.


% Linked to the labour market and production system is the possibility of introducing competing cities. 

% Lots of variations are possible, for instance 2 cities with immigration, differentiated labour, products, market power, neighbourhood effects. % (see extensions map/typology) multiple cities, linear cities, of the system, including the relations with other cities, and larger flows



% \subsubsection{Savings, investment, and retirement behaviour}
% The simple agent decision mechanism % population turnover 
% in our model can be replaced with a more complex set of possibilities at the agent level. Sufficient investment income could lead individuals to locate in cheap properties at the edge of the city.  Income might also be invested in property affecting the quality of a unit. This would require incorporating unit quality in the attribute list for each property, and introducing a quality preference  in the attribute s of residents.

% At retirement,  agents can be allowed to may choose between selling their home, renting it as an income property, or if there is sufficient amenity value for them, staying in the city. Implementing these choices complicates the agent decision and the resulting housing distribution, and requires few changes to the rest of the model. 

% \subsubsection{Rental bidding process}
% Just as with prices, there is an economically \gls{warranted rent} which may differ from the \gls{market rent}. Individuals make their investment decisions on their own expectations rents. the bidding process on rental properties is abstracted in the base model. Instead of modelling the process explicitly, we make the assumption that the warranted rent is the market rent, $\mathcal{R}_W = \mathcal{R}_M$." .. could implement an explicit rental market to model rental prices explicitly.

% \subsubsection{Rent-own choice}
% Introducing a rent-own choice means agents could make decisions about whether they wish to rent or buy. %This may result in the emergence of classes. 
% Agents must have the capacity to borrow to purchase. Attributes of the agents and must now include  net assets,  an available interest rate, and a permissible mortgage.

% We imagine a banker setting the mortgage rates and size. This can be done at the beginning of each period for each agent. 

% With no income differential we expect equal utilities.

% The basic model with earnings differences and a rent-own choice is likely to generate diverging classes as income differentials permit some to capture land rents from others. This situation is likely if borrowing costs decline with income and asset ownership.


\section{Extensions to model of firms}
We have built a simple firm model in which firms hire workers and produce value. Developing a richer firm sector would allow us to have variable wages endogenously, as well as local goods production and even a variety of exports. %The latter is especially interesting with a system of cities. %Explicitly modeling firm behaviour in particular opens up a wide range of nuances to explore.  % Ideally it would involve collaboration with and economist with  a strong interest in industrial structure.  


\subsection{Making labour market and firm behaviour explicit} 
There are two directions to go in order to make firm behaviour explicit. First, we could model individual firms as agents. Second, we could add detail to equilibrium based model we have in our model.  

In the first case, we could explicitly model labour markets and competing firms as firms. In a good example of this approach, Axtell explicitly models all firms in the US market interacting according to simple rules \cite{axtellDynamicsFirmsData2024}. Such a  model could get very large, but it would allow much more nuance in understanding firm behaviour. 

%It would be interesting to study the effects of space and local firm structure and opportunity, with interacting firms and financialization in the land market. 
% We incorporate agglomeration effects at the aggregate level using a Cobb Douglas production function. This allows us to focus on the results of agglomeration in the urban system, rather than specifying the system of firms that transmit the effect.  There are a number of other ways to study the agglomeration process in more or less explicit ways. We could include several representative classes of firms. %There are also very large models. 
% This made sense because our focus  was on the housing market and the financial sector, but the model we have constructed will allow us to ``fill the black box'' with more complete models of the production and labour market to see how they compare to the empirical data. 
% engineers.
% Firm behaviour might also be enriched. 
In the second case, we could add additional detail as an extension of the equilibrium approach implemented in our model. For instance, we could model sectors or labour markets with multiple firms.  % is a natural way to specify the model more completely,  but 
This would require introducing ancillary assumptions and selecting among alternative models of agglomeration. %, and we preferred to focus on distributional and growth-affecting features of the system. We have  developed the link between neoclassical growth theory and the literature on urban scaling \cite{bettencourtIntroductionUrbanScience2021} and  we then imposed the scaling result on our model.  We force the model to conform to the empirical data on the relationship between population and productivity. This amounts to black-boxing the entire production and labour demand sector as well as the construction and housing production sector. 
% The fifth block of extensions illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig-extensions-logic} would 
% We might replace the simple, scaling-based transmission mechanism in the Alonso-Jacobs cycle with explicit firm and labour market behaviour. % This class of extensions is obviously linked to population structure.


% \subsection{Different wages} 
% % introducing workers with different wages. It is not necessary to generate the differences out of the production sector to see how different wages affects the spatial distribute of workers. Sorting by income is the expected result, but our model will allow us to  see if financialization affects the sort and whether public policies can have positive effects

% Introducing income differences %will %not be technically different but will 
% allows us to explore a number of ways impacts may result in segregation by neighbourhood depending on income. Income can be purely earning, which requires a distribution of $w$ across agents. Income  might include investment income, which  a private rate of return and a distribution of assets across agents. It may also be modelled by introducing an explicit model of hiring, firing, and employment that depends on agent skills, experience and firm labour demands.


\subsection{The consumer city}
% At the bottom of the figure we introduce a fourth 
% Another class of intervention, consumer demand, is linked to the population structure and feeding back to growth. 
Our model has assumed there is production only for a perfectly elastic export demand, but in the real world, much of the demand for what is produced in the city is local consumer demand. 
{\color{red}Manufacturing, for example,  typically provides less than a quarter of employment and exports from a city are generally on a similar scale. 
We might therefore consider firms producing different products, some for export some for the local market, and hiring multiple types of labour. We can then imagine a city that has centres of agglomeration by profession or by complementary. This kind of model could allow individual wages to be linked to sectoral agglomeration effects of other workers. %Depending on the production function, this should emerge endogenously within a model extended in this way. %  Consumer needs are buried in the subsistence wage. 

A minimal extension would be to introduce a second sector representing local consumption demand. To do this, a share of locally generated income would support production for the city's population. The labour force would be split between the two sectors. A more complex treatment could introduce a range of service, entertainment and retail producers. This might be done with monopolistically competitive firms as in Dixit and Stiglitz \cite{AvinashK.Dixit1977MCaO}. These extensions are unlikely to affect the allocation of housing

Productivity and wages might differ across sectors. 
Introducing different wages would be a major step toward generating a realistically diverse city. In our model wages would equalize unless low-wage workers are willing to live in the city at different wages. Simply adding more firms or labour types will not give us multiple wages and will not allow us to explore sorting by income. That suggests that we would have to introduce different housing costs, different household structures, different transportation costs and/or a secondary benefit for some workers.  } Extensions such as these would be expected to have effects on housing markets. %For example, savings behaviour would likely become more complex with endogenous consumer demand. % and with as more complex population structure.
%.   {\color{red} ADD MORE EFFECTS}

Both agent based and equilibrium models of explicit firm behaviour would make it possible to explore the effects of different skills, and wages. An agent model could allow much more nuanced exploration of adjacent properties, including questions about amenity, sectors, and individual behaviour. 



\section{Extensions to model of the institutional, legal, and financial mechanisms distributing the urban surplus}
The forecast rents and thus bids agents are willing to pay for property embed a minimal model of the contract and legal structure for the distribution of surplus value produced in the city. This is a minimal model of the institutional arrangement linking production and rents via the land market. While minimal, this linkage is among the most precisely specified components of our model, and extensions to the model open up a number of interesting questions. 


\subsection{Urban savings}
% TODO THIS IS A CONTRIBUTION, BUT ALSO A DISCUSSION OF ONE WAY THIS WORK COULD BE EXTENDED, MIXED WITH A BIT OF MODEL DESCRIPTION
Conventional growth models specify a savings/investment mechanism at the national level. To our knowledge, this has not been done for the city level. We require savings at two levels. First, since we want to incorporate households, home ownership, and a relationship to the financial sector through mortgages, we specify a savings rate out of the spending we have isolated in the `subsistence wage' This means that both urban and rural workers accumulate savings, that savings are age-dependent, making the size of mortgage available also age dependent. 
Homeowners in addition have equity $E=P-M$ in their homes. % ({\color{red} Should newcomers also have equity? or is it built into the savings. Clarify this.} 
{A second level of saving is the investment in capital out of the city surplus.} %Even raising this question puts us into terra incognita. 

\subsection{Making public infrastructure investment explicit}
We incorporated a property tax in the investment model but did not explicitly model how the revenue was spent. Public and private investment in human capital is largely urban as well, but as with infrastructure, investment and response take effect over time periods much longer than our model is concerned with. Private sector innovation in technology, marketing, or products draws on local saving less but still significantly on local savings. We have little in the way of theory or empirical research on this channel. Lags between investment and any rise in the urban wage premium are almost certainly long and variable. 

One target is public investment in transportation infrastructure. We have discussed how falling transportation costs increase surplus generation.  We can set easily make transport cost depend on investments out of the property tax. Investments like this are made slowly and adjust and take effect over time periods that are very long compared to the variables our model has been concerned with. We can introduce deterioration and set the property tax sufficient to maintain the stock of infrastructure,  or we can allow debt. 
There may be many other channels through which surplus flows into productive investment in the urban context. 

The scaling literature also provides relationships between density, population and infrastructure cost that we can explore as well. In the scaling literature, these relationships are increasingly theorized in terms of network effects, which is consistent with the Jacobs analysis and the more recent neoclassical growth modeling.


\subsection{Domestic investment}
 It is known that local ownership is associated with local investment. We have dealt with this by linking local capital ownership with the scale factor, with local capital ownership proxied by homeowner equity as a share of the local housing stock.

\subsection{Distribution of rents}
Rents go to landowners, with a share taken for maintenance and taxes.
Rents may also be taxed, could be shared between multiple owners, etc.
 %\note{REPHRASE? rent is  extracted from the coalition of capital and workers.} % Rents may also be taxed, could be shared between multiple owners, etc. 
%The rents are captured by landowners.  The capture of rents by landowners is common buy not necessary. 
In principle the gains from urban productivity and amenity can be allocated as social wealth through shared ownership, as is often done on a small scale with cooperatives and land trusts, distributed to all citizens through something like a social wealth fund, or captured in taxes or fees as Henry George suggested. 
%The rents would otherwise go to labour and capital.



\subsection{Investment fund modelling}
Agents may fund their retirement from savings, as well as returns on their home if they have one to sell. Savings may be invested in a pension fund, or in local property,  depending on expected risks and returns. In the real world, financial institution manages most pensions, investing in the market or in property.  This institutional structure might be handled by implementing a savings account for each agent. % We are not interested in the detailed investment behaviour for the financial sector.% either in the stock market, or in pensions.
% Institutional and individual investors can access debt. %
We could also consider a case where outside money can come under institutional management, not just local retirement savings. A parameter would control the inflow of additional money beyond local investment in the pension fund. 

\subsection{Transaction costs}
Transaction costs on the sale of property are omitted. They are actually large. We can easily add a term to  Equation~\ref{eqn:maximum-bid} to examine the effect of transaction costs on the distribution of wealth.


\subsection{Risk, speculation, and business cycles}

There are many areas to explore in terms of the dynamics of the model. Risk plays a role in property markets. For example in Canada, backing mortgages is the largest fiscal 
investment at the national level \cite{nemtinFinancializationHousingSocial2021}. It is also possible to model the effect of speculative over-investment as expectations rise and fall, and the effects of business cycles as forcing of price and other parameters with external input to examine the effects.

\subsection{Taxes and productivity} % municipal government, public goods, and productivity}
This is a major issue with considerable development in the economics literature. Property taxes reduce the net locational value that flows to an individual owner but provides services and wages that make the city attractive. 
% TODO (create a regime where particular groups have an advantage)
Localized tax advantages can move a share of financialised investment into private consolidation of land, 
including the structure of taxes for investment properties, institutional investors, individuals, etc.

Just as finacialization may extract resources that would otherwise be invested in increasing human capital, consumption or productivity, reducing productivity. Taxes could either be extracted or reinvested. There is some evidence taxes can increase productivity through infrastructure, education, public spaces, recruiting employers, and direct investment, etc. Re-distributive programs are expected to have direct distributional effects. These could be explored through additional linkages in the model.

% This is a synoptic view of the future we hope for this model. In the following sections we provide a fuller discussion of some of these directions and mention some other that are less immediate for us. 

%The basic model can be initialized by matching the number of properties to the size of the population. % TODO check this, it is an old description.

\subsection{Financialization as system change} \label{section-system}
We established that, at least in theory, financial institutions and the wealthy are likely to own increasing shares of the housing stock. The theoretical conclusions is consistent with what has already happened in the Canadian Housing market. Recent data from Statistics Canada \cite{fontaineResidentialRealEstate2023} suggests people who own more than one property in Ontario make up more than 25\% of buyers in the province. (The proportion of investors among owners varied from 20.2\% in Ontario to 31.5\% in Nova Scotia.)
Just under one in five properties overall was used as an investment.
In Ontario 41.9\% of condominium apartments are investment properties \cite{statisticscanadaBuyRentHousing2022}.

The immediate social implications are fairly obvious. As Statistics Canada points out, these trends might limit the number of properties available to buyers who intend to use it as a primary place of residence  \cite{fontaineResidentialRealEstate2023}. Statistics Canada reports that latest census release, two-thirds of Canadians owned a home in 2021, down from a peak of 69 per cent a decade earlier. The decline is was higher for younger members of the population. 

When the homeownership rate goes down, the rental rate goes up. The 2021 Canadian Housing Survey reported that the number of renter households increased  at over twice the pace of owner households, pushing down the homeownership rate in Canada. If the trends continue, Urban Canada will gradually change from a society dominated by homeowners to a predominantly tenant society. Since wealthier buyers are advantaged in the market, the younger and poorer parts of the community will be increasingly excluded from ownership. Financialization will increase income and asset inequality in cities.

Combined with rising housing prices the effect will be to squeeze lower-wage households closer to what we have termed to subsistence level and make it harder for low-wage workers to live in the city. The city requires low-wage workers for many of the services, so labour shortages are a possibility. Labour shortages will squeeze some activities out of the city and are likely to reduce productivity. Labour shortages may push up wages, but in rental markets, landlords can capture much of any increase in wages. 

The incentive structure in our model was derived purely from the point of view of an individual investor. Examination shows that investment incentives favour the wealthy and institutional buyers, but that does not necessarily imply that the process of financialization will drive social transformations. % Individual choices are at most  a link in the chain.
Modelling  allows us to ask %identify 
which parameters are most influential. 
A question that is especially important is whether the process of financialization and tenentization our micro model suggests is reversible.%:  high levels of home ownership we have seen throughout the 20$^{th}$ century. %, as Purdy

% - it can lead to efforts to extract more rents by displacing people to invest in a shift in built form.
%There are a number of potential links with the development process.

% \section{Building out the foundation of the model}

% \section{Variations in the model}

% \subsection{Residents}

% Residents, currently choose whether to work in the urban center or not, and receive identical wages. They differ in their available resources, the savings they begin/enter with. We can introduce more nuanced agent heterogeneity. They may have different incomes, skills, preferences, or transportation patterns. Much of the complexity of the model is in the financial decision making process, which can be further nuanced. Residents may also act as consumers as well as workers, creating local consumer demand.

% Buyers could consider neighbourhood pressures, demographic changes, changes in job location, desire for amenity etc. in their assessment of housing need. 

% With multiple bids agents can place the most competitive bids on those homes they prefer. If they have higher urgency they place strong bids on more homes. 

% Next buyers request a selection of homes to consider from a real estate agent. Those with higher need for housing look at more homes. The real estate agent offers a selection of homes based on the agent's requirements. A randomness parameter determines how many divergent houses are also considered. When the parameter is 1, the selection of homes is fully randomized, When it is 0, the agent sorts all available homes and offers those which fit the agents budget, space, and other requirements best.


% \subsubsection{Population pressure} 

% % {\color{red}The first ?}
% Another extension is to move from a static population to a model with population pressure. % This appears on the left as a group of three new subroutines with connections to the elements of the model most directly affected. % Some links are left out to keep the figure readable. Examples of omitted links  are the channels through which  population affects labour supply and savings.  
% Our basic model does not have a growing population. This conveniently allows us to isolate certain effects of financialization. Population pressure is one of the drivers of financialization because it amplifies speculative gains, however. As a result, one of the first extensions must be  to introduce population pressure.

% There are two sources to consider: 
% \begin{enumerate}
% \item Agglomeration effects that increase the wage and attract workers faster than the housing stock can respond. 

% Worker agents from outside the city can always consider moving and accepting a job. 
% % QUESTION - how to manage the flow of new agents?
% %, or can make more from rents and moving away
% \item Immigration pressure.
% \end{enumerate}
% Under the  first, agglomeration economies drive population while under the second, population growth may drive agglomeration.

% The growth of the housing stock will generally lag population growth, generating price effects and stock dynamics.
% Agents will respond to increases in demand conditions. The perception that the market is tight or that prices are rising may lead to higher bids and reservation prices and shift results in favour of sellers.

% If population exceeds the number of properties there are three margins to consider
% 	\begin{enumerate}
% 		\item The land supply can increase. There may be a conversion cost
% 		\item The land per-capita may decrease. This is not simple in a city with land-use regulations, zoning, and fixed capital in homes. A conversion process has to be defined
% 		\item A homeless population can emerge. 
% 	\end{enumerate}


% \subsubsection{Forward looking agents}
% There are reasons to expect the results obtained with  forward-looking agents to differ substantially from those obtained with a model featuring myopic agents.\footnote{For example, Lecca et al. *** \cite{leccaForwardlookingMyopicRegional2013}  used a stylized computational macroeconomic model applicable to a regional context to demonstrate that the assumption of myopic vs. forward-looking agents yields differences in the dynamics generated by a shock perturbing the initial steady state, even though the alternative paths lead to the same long-run equilibrium.} 

% \subsubsection{Unemployment and labour adjustment costs}

% We could introduce unemployment and \glspl{labour adjustment cost} for firms. %***INTERESTING TO THINK ABOUT  when people would stop working with % falls to subsistence wage - too much rent, I guess they leave, they can always move somewhere
% in the agent model, employees are simply laid off and seek work, so there is unemployment, but there are not \glspl{labour adjustment cost} for firms.

% \subsubsection{Business cycles}
% How does this connect with a business cycle. e.g. driving it with price signals connects this with a whole body of work with e.g. the work of Fabrice Collard.

% \subsection{Broader questions for future work}

% \section{Variations in method and validation}

% % In the above sections, we've detailed several promising directions for future work using this base model. %, as well as ways to expand the model, and connect with other work. 
% In addition to extending the model, there are variations in what we do with the model or how we validate it. We may do more experiments, better characterize the model, or integrate it more systematically with data, or use it with different audiences. %, as well as to combine experiments to explore phenomena. 


% \begin{enumerate}
%     \item extension to the model, 
%     \item the integration of additional data, 
%     \item furthur analysis, experimentation, and exploration.
% \end{enumerate}



% \subsection{Experimentation}
% % \subsubsection{Initial state and parameter values}
% % Basic experiments has all homes owner occupied to start. Other initial tenure mixtures are easily modelled.% WHY WE MIGHT WANT TO

% % The basic model can be initialized by matching the number of properties to the size of the population. 

% % In the simplest version, firms concentrate at the city centre. Workers are spread over space and pay transportation costs to commute.

% % The size of the city is determined by population and lot size. Income and transportation costs will interact with lot size. 


% % \subsubsection{Sensitivity analysis}

% % mapping of regimes

% More comprehensive analysis include comprehensive sensitivity analysis, and exploration of statistical issues, and exploration of the non-linear dynamics, hysteresis, and resilience. % Nonlinear dynamics, resilience, and hystersis
% These models may exhibit irreversibilities in variables such as distribution, homelessness, city form, and class structure. 
% A straightforward strategy for examining the system resilience is to shock a model (experiment) and then see if diagnostic variables recover. % (This needs more precise expression.) % While there  are many variations on the basic urban model and many potential experiments with each model there are only a few of immediate interest if the goal is to test the ``resilience'' of equilibria.
% A first step would be shocks adding - cyclic behavour to price, shocks  to the labour market.

% including with more comprehensive sensitivity and xx analysis, and analysis of the nonlinear dynamics, hysteresis and resilience properties, 
% There are also combinations all of these above, for instance:

% The basic model with earnings differences and variable lot size: 
% The wealthy would likely larger homes and lots farther form the centre

% This model would likely produce some interesting spatial patterns, especially if couples with the possibility of secondary central places.

% The basic model with earnings (Y) differences, constant lot size and variable density: This model should produce some interesting spatial patterns, especially if coupled with the possibility of secondary central places.

% \subsubsection{Lags and adjustment processes}
% The details of the adjustment process and the system lags are selected primarily for convenience in simulations. Real-time lags are important and complex, we explore some sensitivity results, but can explore more. 

% We model a fairly short lag although in reality lags are long and variable. 
% In practice these are combinatoric, each experiment may be combined with many others. We don't go into details on rich set of ways this model may be connected or be a part in the models of others (DEREK'S), for instance replacing the stylized model of transportation costs with rich empirical model of a transportation system as a dynamic system like that in the work of XX, or replace the representative urban firm model with an evolving system of agent based firms \cite{axtellDynamicsFirmsData2024}. 

% \subsection{Data}
% n each case, to make claims about the world, whether predictive or explanatory, that go beyond illustration and 
% theoretical exposition, requires engagement with data.  %Also possibl eot change the purpose of modelling

%  or other explorations with the model. We can also bring in new data. using it for something related to practice - as a boundary object for social learning.

% There is also potential for this work to expand to engage with other fields and be used in practice.

% \subsection{Audiences}
% ABMs can be run multiple times to produce distributions of expected outcomes, which makes them valuable in planning exercises.
% We divide experiments into two categories 1. more comprehensive analysis of of the model and 2 experiments to answer new questions

% as boundary object, etc.
% USE WITH PEOPLE IN SCENARIOS ETC
% Use in scenario exercises

\section{Summary}
% Changes to this model, keeping the same basic agents and equilibrium assumptions, and changes to that basic structure, for instance to introduce a multi-agent model of firm behaviour. % In our agent based model, in which every lot is  addressable, it is simple to 
% For instance, we might introduce zoning boundaries, local amenities, different densities or housing qualities and homes of different sizes. % Hundreds of experiments are possible exploiting  the extensibility we have carefully conserved.  
% Likely few of the possible extensions would affect our qualitative results, however 
% In addition to changing the structure of the model, we can also bringing in data, characterising the model engaging with statistical issues including non-linear analysis and hysteresis, integrating data or exploring policy alternatives.
% incorporating these extensions, we can explore relatively fine-grained effects of financialization.
The simplifications in the model described in this document
% This simple case allows
allow us to focus on the general, and neglected, distributional features of this class of models. In this chapter we've sketched several promising directions to extend the model, 
% discussed ways the model can be extended and suggest further hypotheses that we  would like to test using our model. We divide 
dividing extensions by the three main elements of the model: the model of the city and it's land market, the model of firms and production, and the model of the institutional and legal structures by which some agents may claim a share of the value created in the city. % These extensions would substantially enrich our understanding of the urban system and the process of the financialization of housing.
Introducing many of these changes, such multiple wages, amenity, and differing densities are relatively simple. The resulting sorting by wealth, income and preference is of considerable interest for social policy. The extensions will allow us to test whether financialization affects the sort and whether public policies can have positive effects. It's likely none of them would change our qualitative results greatly, however each would deepen our understanding of mechanisms and of the detailed impacts. 

% three broad categories of extensions. %The main questions for immediate future work, connections with existing bodies of work, and the extensions needed to build out the base of this model and make it more rigorous.
