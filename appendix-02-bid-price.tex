\section{Modelling the market process}
The core machinery of the model  is the market process. At the centre of that process is a bargaining model. 


\begin{enumerate}
    \item Identify set of sellers for the current cycle. 
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{people retiring in this cycle}
   {\color{yellow} \item people who retired and failed to sell
    \item people approaching retirement who might consider selling early.
    \item the bank}
\end{enumerate}
    
 
    \item For each seller get expected property price \textbf{from real estate agent}:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item     Initialize with the warranted price = rent + housing costs. \textit{This is the value of the stream of services.}

   \[ P^e_0=\frac{(\omega-{c}{d}) + {a}\psi}{r}\]
The value of the house is the rent premium minus the cost of transportation. Subtract the the costs of running the house, divided by the interest rate

IS IT MINUS A $\psi$ SINCE HIGHER COSTS LOWER PRICES?
   
{\color{green} This is the expected warranted price. It might make sense just to use the homeowner's reservation price (maximum bid price)}.
   \item in later cycles use the actual transaction price $P_{it}$ (with inflation added) when it is available, or use a (regression)estimate  $P^e_{it}$  the real estate agent
\end{enumerate}

 
    \item for each seller, compute a reservation price using a variant of the maximum bid price formula. 

    {\color{green}\textit{Values like $m_i$ are going to be expected values for others.  ??? }}
    
    \textit{This is what the seller thinks she should get, taking into account her expectations about the price increase etc..}
    
    \item for each seller, compute an asking price. 
    
    \textit{Add some percentage to the reservation price. Make sure the result is above $P^e$, since you know you might have to come down in bargaining.}   
    \item for each seller, list the asking price for bidders to see.
        
    \item for each property, identify a set of potential bidders.
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Bank considers bidding on all listed properties.

        the formula is the maximum bid price with its own parameters putting in the current rents.
        \item New entrants to labour market
       {\color{yellow} \item Retirees who might sell, move out of town and invest in a rental property}
    \end{enumerate}

  
    \item for each bidder, compute a maximum price using a variant of the bid price formula. 
    
    
    \item for each bidder, compute an initial bid no higher than  the maximum price. 
     \color{red}  
   \textbf{(there may be two paths to consider: working from initial bids, or working with max bids )}

    \item With list of max bids, check to see if any exceed the asking price. 
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item If yes settle on asking price if there is just one, and the second highest max bid if there are more than one

        \item    if no, proceed
    \end{enumerate}
    
    
    \item With list of max bids, check to see if any exceed the reservation price. 
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item If no, house is not sold, and reservation price is reduced for the next cycle.
        \item if one max exceeds the reservation price,  split the difference between the reservation price and the maximum bid bid.
        \item if more than one max exceeds the reservation price, choose the second highest max bid if there are more than one
    \end{enumerate} 
\end{enumerate} \color{black}

 \section{Bid Price}
To model the market transactions when speculative motives are in play we need an expression for  how much financial investors will bid. More specifically, we need to find the maximum price that they are willing to pay. As Horowitz \cite{horowitzBiddingModelsHousing1986} notes, a prospective buyer  considering knows a vector of attributes of the house, the sellerâ€™s asking price and the property taxes, transaction costs, and financing costs at a specified price. The  potential buyer also is likely to have estimates of the maintenance costs and resale value of the house, although these may be highly subjective. For our bidding model, therefore, we need find how much financial investors will bid in terms of these variables.


 We assume that agent may be  speculating on potential \glspl{capital gain} as well as on the \gls{use value} or net market rent they get from the property. We therefore treat the purchase as an investment decision and compute a rate of return, $v$, conditional on the price paid. This allows us to solve for the maximum bid, $P_{max}^{bid}$ that achieves the desired rate of return. 

 
 The agent purchases makes a down payment, $D$ on a house for a price, $P_0$, and agrees to payoff a mortgage with interest at the end of the mortgage period. For expositional convenience we can treat the mortgage period $T$ as a single term and express all quantities  in present-value terms. The Agent 
 and receives the increased price $P_T = (1 + \dot P)P_0$, back after a period $T$, Where $\dot P$ is the expected rate of price increase. The agent also receives either the net market rental value of the property, $\mathcal{R}^w_N$, or if the owner is also the resident, the locational rents.

 \subsection{The value of an investment}
The value of the investment $V$ is therefore the capital gain, minus financing costs, plus the rents, net of operating costs and taxes, $\mathcal{R}_N$.
 
 This may be written in terms of the purchase price, and several individual parameters: interest  rate, share of the price that can be mortgaged and  discount rate:\footnote{The down payment could be deducted in advance, but if the discount rate is equal to the interest rate it drops out completely.}
 
 
\begin{align}
V &= \delta \left(P_T - (1+r)M\right) +   \mathcal{R}^w_N   \\
&= \delta \left((1+\dot P) P_0 - (1+r)mP_0\right)  +      \mathcal{R}^w_N \\
%V &=& \delta \left(P_T - (1+r)M\right) +  \mathcal{R}^w_N\\
  &= \delta \left((1+\dot P)    - (1+r)m    \right) P_0 + \mathcal{R}^w_N 
\end{align}

This is the net present value of buying, and selling after one planning period. All rates are scaled to the length of the period to avoid the need for compounding calculations. The has 4 individualized  parameters, $\delta$, $\dot p$, $r$, $m$, as well as any factors that affect the rent term.

\subsection{Rate of return on investment}
The rate of return on funds invested is V divided by the size of the down payment, $D$ to get the rate of return  

\begin{align}
r^{return} 
  &= \frac{V}{D}  \nonumber \\
  &= \left(\delta \left(1+\dot P - (1+r)m\right) \ \right) \frac{P_0}{D}  + \frac{\mathcal{R}^w_N }{D}      \nonumber \\
  &= \left(\delta \left(1+\dot P - (1+r)m\right)  \right) \frac{P_0}{P_0-mP_0} +  \frac{\mathcal{R}^w_N }{P_0-mP_0}  \\ 
  &= \frac{\delta \left(1+\dot P - (1+r)m\right) }{1-m} +\frac{\mathcal{R}^w_N }{(1-m)P_0}.
\label{eqn-property-investment-return1}
\end{align}

\subsection{Criterion for investment}
Equation~\ref{eqn-property-investment-return1} provides a criterion for investors. Agents invest if if their expected return is greater than the target return, they are seeking:
\begin{equation}\Large
r^{target}\le v 
\label{eqn-property-investment-return2}
\end{equation}

% So the condition is 




% \begin{align*}
% r^{target} \le \frac{\delta \left(1 + \dot P - (1+r)m\right)}{1-m} + \frac{\mathcal{R}^w_N}{(1-m)P_0^{bid}}\tag{B7}
% \end{align*}


 %.    THIW\S  MAY BE NEEDED
% \begin{align*}
% P_{max}^{bid} \le &   \frac{\mathcal{R}^w_N}{(1-m_i)r_i^{target} - \delta_i \left(1 + L(P) - (1+r_i)m_i \right)} \tag{B10}\\
% 		 \le &   \frac{ \omega - {c}*d + a\psi -   ba\psi - ca\psi}{(1-m_i)r_i^{target} - \delta_i \left(1 + L(P) - (1+r_i)m_i \right)}	\\	
%    		 \le &   \frac{ \omega - {c}*d + a(1-b-c)\psi}{(1-m_i)r_i^{target} - \delta_i \left(1 + L(P) - (1+r_i)m_i \right)}	
% \end{align*}

For that analysis we  added a use-value, $U$ in place of rent for expatriate owners to represent using the property - say one month a year - when they are not renting the property and a \textbf{vacancy tax}, $T$ at rate $t$ to affect the speculator's  decision.} %\cite{Al-Shihabi}

% 	&=& \left(  \delta (1+\dot P)-1    + m \quad - m-\delta rm  + (\rho-\kappa)\right)P_0
% \end{eqnarray}
 % Where $\mathcal{R}$, $\mathcal{O}$, $\mathcal{T}$, and $M$ are total rent, operating costs, tax payments, and mortgage borrowed, as net present values at the end of the period. The interest rate is $r$, and the discount factor $\delta$. % I don't like this. I think it makes sense for them to be total payments over the period, but I now think it would be more intuitive to compute them as net present values at the start of the period, since that is when the mortgage is borrowed and the decision is made.

 %It has  seven  parameters, $\delta, \dot P, r, m, \rho, \kappa$ and $t$. The first four, $\delta, \dot P, r$ and $m$ are exogenous for the investor while $\rho$, $\kappa$ and $t$  are    %Operating revenue and costs $\rho, \kappa$ and $t$ are expressed as  present values. 

%Agents borrow a share of the purchase price, $P$. The amount borrowed is the mortgage, $M$. This is a share of the total purchase price $mP = M$. The \gls{mortgage term}, $T$, is the period it takes to pay down the mortgage.

%\section{Return on investment}

% The rate of return on funds invested, $r_{return}$, is the value divided by the size of the down payment, $D$: 
% %The rate of return is $v = \frac{V}{D}$. %For expat investors, we get a \textbf{decision rule}:
% %\begin{enumerate}
% %\item  if $v \geq a$ (with some private use?) with no rent,  don't bother renting. 
% %\item If $v(no\ rent\ and\ tax) < a\geq v(with\ rent)$,  then  rent. 
% %\item If $ v(with\ rent) \le a $,  then sell 
% %\end{enumerate}\
% \begin{eqnarray}
% r^{return} 
%   &=& \frac{V}{D}  \nonumber \\
%   &=& \left(\delta \left(1+\dot P - (1+r)m\right) \ + \rho - \theta - \tau \right) \frac{P_0}{D}        \nonumber \\
%   &=& \left(\delta \left(1+\dot P - (1+r)m\right) \ + \rho - \theta - \tau \right) \frac{P_0}{P_0-mP_0} \nonumber \\ 
%   &=& \frac{\delta \left(1+\dot P - (1+r)m\right) \ + \rho - \theta - \tau }{1-m}.
% \label{eqn-property-investment-return1}
% \end{eqnarray}
% Equation~\ref{eqn-property-investment-return1} provides a criterion for investors. Agents invest if if their expected return is greater than the target return, they are seeking:
% \begin{equation}
% r^{return} \geq r^{target}. 
% \label{eqn-property-investment-return2}
% \end{equation}




 

%This is the maximum price that satisfies the criterion $r^{return} \geq r^{target}$.  The bid price is used in the price determination process in our model. %Where the return is the value over the down payment:
% Equation \ref{eqn-property-investment-return1} expresses the expected return on investment in terms of the  market price, $P_0$: 
% \begin{eqnarray*}
%  r^{return} 
%    &=& \frac{V}{D} \\
%    &=& \frac{\delta \left(1+\dot P - (1+r)m\right) \ + \rho - \theta - \tau}{1-m}.
% \end{eqnarray*}
%which we define as the ``bid price'',% $P^{max}_{bid}$. 
%We return to Equation~\ref{eqn-property-investment-value3} %
%We start by writing the value of the investment, from Equation \ref{eqn-property-investment-value1}, with the net rent. %, which can be written a share, $\phi$ of total rent $\mathcal{R}_N = \phi \mathcal{R}$, %The net rent can also be written as a share, $\phi$, of the rent 
%: %(originally from Chapter \ref{chapter-financialization} on Financialization. Since the rent is a known quantity at the beginning of the term, independent of the current, so we reformulate net rent,  $\mathcal{R}$, $\mathcal{O}$, $\mathcal{T}$ as a fraction of total rent: 

% \begin{eqnarray}
% V &=& \delta \left(P_T - (1+r)M\right) +      \mathcal{R}_N   \nonumber \\
%   % &=& \delta \left(P_T - (1+r)M\right) + \mathcal{R}_N   \nonumber \\
%   % &=& \delta \left(P_T - (1+r)m P_0\right) + \mathcal{R}_N \nonumber \\
%   &=& \delta \left((1+\dot P)P_0 - (1+r)m P_0\right)     + \mathcal{R}_N \nonumber \\
%   &=& \delta \left((1+\dot P)    - (1+r)m    \right) P_0 + \mathcal{R}_N
% \label{eqn-property-investment-value3}
% \end{eqnarray}


% Dividing by the down payment, $D = (1-m)P_0$:
% \begin{eqnarray}
% r_{return} = \frac{\delta \left(1 + \dot P - (1+r)m\right)}{1-m} + \frac{\mathcal{R}_N}{(1-m)P_0}
% \end{eqnarray}




% +++++++++++++++ JUST REPLACED BETWEEN THESE WITH THE ABOVE. CHECK IT'S OKAY
% % We also have to assume that $P^{bid}=P_0$, which we can justify as an equilibrium condition - investors believe they are paying the market price. The result is 
% % \[V= \delta(P^T- (1+r)M)   +\phi r P^{bid}\]

% % The price at the end of the term $T$, $P_T$, is a predicted value for the investor \textit{ex-ante}, so we can replace $P^T$ in Equation~\ref{eqn-property-investment-value3} with the predictor, $(1+\dot P)P^{bid}$. 
% % We can replace $P^T$ in Equation~\ref{eqn-property-investment-value3} with $(1+\dot P)P_0$.
% \[V= \delta \left((1+\dot P)P_0 - (1+r)m P_0\right) +\phi \mathcal{R}\] 
% Then we replace $\dot P$ with an estimate, $L(P)$, representing an estimated function of the lagged values of $P$ and any  other relevant data. We imagine the potential investor informed estimates by information from  real estate agents or analysts.  The result is 
% \[V= \delta \left((1+L(P))P^{bid}- (1+r)mP^{bid}\right) +\phi \mathcal{R}\]
% Combining terms:
% \[V= \delta \left((1+L(P))- (1+r)m \right) P^{bid} +\phi \mathcal{R}\]

% WHY BIG BRACKETS NOT SHOWING UP

% The rate of return $r_{return}=V/D=V/(1-m)P^{bid}$ is then

% \[r_{return}= \frac{\delta \left((1+L(P) - (1+r)m\right)}{1-m} + \frac{\phi \mathcal{R}}{(1-m)P^{bid}}\]

% %++++++++++++++++

% \begin{align}  
%   v  & =  \frac{\delta ((1+\dot P)  - (1+r)m)\  + \psi r}{1-m}\label{eq:RULE}\\

%   &=&\delta\left( (1+L(p)) - (1+r)m \right) P^{bid} + \mathcal{R}_N  \nonumber
% \end{eqnarray}

\subsection{Maximum bid} % given the rate of return}

Agents bid if the RHS is larger than the target rate of return, as stated in Equation \ref{eqn-property-investment-return2}.  $P_0$ with $P^{bid}$, and $\dot P$ with an estimator for $\dot P$, we get: %TO DO REPLACE PDOT - MAYBE WITH TILDE AND DOT..: 

\begin{eqnarray}
r_{target} \le \frac{\delta \left((1+ \dot P^e - (1+r)m\right)}{1-m} + \frac{\mathcal{R}_N}{(1-m)P^{bid}}
\end{eqnarray}

Solving for $P_{bid}$:


\begin{align}
r^{target} &\le \frac{\delta \left(1 + \dot P^e - (1+r)m\right)}{1-m}   +\frac{\mathcal{R}_N}{(1-m)P^{bid}}. \nonumber \\
(1-m)r^{target} &\le \ \ \delta \left(1 + \dot P^e - (1+r)m\right) + \frac{\mathcal{R}_N}{P^{bid}} \nonumber \\ %\delta(1+L(P))- (1+r)m%
(1-m)r^{target} - \delta \left(1 + \dot P^e - (1+r)m\right)  &\le  \frac{\mathcal{R}_N}{P^{bid}} \nonumber\\
P^{bid} & \le    \frac{\mathcal{R}_N}{(1-m)r^{target}-\delta \left(1 + \dot P^e - (1+r)m\right)} 
% P^{bid} & \le    \frac{\mathcal{R}_N}{(1-m)r^{target}-\left[ \delta(1+L(P)- (1+r)m\right]} \nonumber 
\label{eqn-bid-price1}
\end{align}
The denominator is an adjusted rate of return for capitalizing net rents, analogous to the value of $r$ in Equation~\ref{eq:Capitalization}. 

Each agent has their own interest rates, discount rates, mortgage share, information, and expectations, so individual bids can differ.

% \begin{align}
% P_i^{bid} \le   \frac{\mathcal{R}_N}{(1-m_i)r_i^{target} - \delta_i \left(1 + L(P) - (1+r_i)m_i \right)}.
% \label{eqn-bid-price2}
% \end{align}

% \begin{eqnarray}%. OLD VERSION: WRONG
% %r^{target}&=& \delta\left( (1+L(p)) - (1+r)m \right) P^{max}_{bid} + \mathcal{R}_N  \nonumber\\
%    P^{max}_{bid} &=&\frac{r^{target} - \mathcal{R}_N}{\delta\left((1+L(p)) - (1+r)m \right)} %\label{EqBidPrice2} 
% \end{eqnarray}

% \section{Finding bid price}
% We start with Equation~\ref{B2}. for convenience, replace $\rho -\kappa - \sigma $ with $\mathcal{R}_N$ (net Rent). 

% Replace $P^T$ with $(1+\dot P)P^{bid}$ assuming that the bidder is bidding the equilibrium market price for the period.

% Then replace   $\dot P$ with $L(p)$ representing some (estimated function ($\tilde{\dot P}$)) of the lagged values of $P$ that incorporates other data. 

% \begin{eqnarray}
% v&=& \delta(P^T- (1+r)M) \qquad \qquad \qquad 	 + \mathcal{R}_N \nonumber\\
%  &=&\delta\left( (1+\dot P)P^{bid} - (1+r)mP^{bid} \right)  + \mathcal{R}_N  \nonumber\\
%   &=&\delta\left( (1+L(p)) - (1+r)m \right) P^{bid} + \mathcal{R}_N  \nonumber
% \end{eqnarray}

% So I want to use this relationship to find the maximum bid price for the bank. The rule is, ``Bid if the RHS is larger than the target rate of return, $r^{target}$, and do not bid if it is smaller.''  The maximum bid  is the bid that makes the two sides equal. 

% {\color{red}
% \begin{eqnarray}
% r^{target}&=& \delta\left( (1+L(p)) - (1+r)m \right) P^{max}_{bid} + \mathcal{R}_N  \nonumber\\
%    P^{max}_{bid} &=&\frac{r^{target}-\mathcal{R}_N}{\delta\left( (1+L(p)) - (1+r)m \right)} \label{EqBidPrice} 
% \end{eqnarray}}
% %(What makes. this work is that I do not use an identity to get $\dot P$, which made the system of equations singular.)

\section{The period and time value of money}

In developing the model we introduced a number of rates, such as $r_i$, the rate that individual $i$ pays for a single borrowing period. The payment calculation is made for a period of length $T$, which we refer to as a mortgage term.
%This means the actual interest paid is a compounded interest rates (VARIABLES LIST FOR THIS).

%In developing the theoretical model we introduced a number of rates, such as $r_i$, the rate that  individual $i$ pays for a single period of borrowing. We assume the calculations are for a  period of length  $T$, which we refer to as a mortgage term. This means that the rates in equations such XXXXX are actually compounded rates.
Taking a simplified example, if the rate is $x$/year, interest payments are $xM$, a share of the total mortgage amount borrowed, $M$, for each of $T$ years. 
If the interest payments are all made at the end of the mortgage term, the lender will require interest on the deferred interest, so agent $i$'s payment at the end of the period $T$ will be:

\begin{align*}
\text{Payment} &= (1+r_i)M                                 \\ 
    &= M + xM(1+x)^{T-1}+ xM(1+x)^{T-2}\dots + xM(1+x)^{0} \\
    &= M\left(1+ x\sum_{z=T-1}^0(1+x)^{z}\right).          \\ 
\end{align*}
Therefore, the interest payment is:
\begin{align*}
r_i.   &=x\sum_{z=T-1}^0(1+x)^{z}.
\end{align*}

For the sake of notational simplicity and clarity of exposition,  we omit the compounding formula throughout our discussion. This means that, while banks may quote a per period interest rates, the equations use a compounded rate. In the computational model we employ the appropriately compounded values. All %the rates are compounded in this way to provide a per-period rates, including all 
 the interest rates, the $r$'s, are compounded in this way, because they require annual or monthly payments at their stated rates.
 It does not affect the discount rates, the $\delta$'s, or the borrowing ratio $m_i$, because they are initially calculated for the term and don't require the same period payments.
 The discount factor $\delta_i$ is always a compounded version of $x$:
 \[\delta_i=\left(\frac{1}{1+x}\right)^T\].
%is a feature of the individual, so it is not affected in this way.
%The appropriate compunding expressions for other rates are displayed below.

 The {mortgage term}, $T$, is the period after which the mortgage must be repaid with interest. We work with a mortgage terms for two reasons. First, in the theoretical analysis, by transforming the multi-period transaction to a single period, we simplify the comprehensibility of the analysis. Second, it reflects the fact that in practice agents  likely consider the profitability of a purchase for a finite term longer than one period. The term period lets them consider the time cost of money in their analysis in a natural way. Parameters for their discounting rates and the term considered can be used to explore the effect of borrowing costs and their personal discounting rates on their decisions. Future interest rates are also not fully known. In the future, we can also vary the compound interest rates to explore the impact of uncertainty, given agents' guesses about the future, and their level of risk aversion.



\section{Warranted rents}

 The warranted price of the property is the present value of the \glspl{warranted economic rent} ***? %\gls{warranted rents}% *** Note the warranted price may be rising. This is a problem for  us. WHY?
 
% NOTE Some of the taxes and most of the repairs/maintenance costs are for the building and not the for the locational value of the land. These two have correlated values. (we can't separate the amount of house and quality form our locational decision ) 

%**** We would like to  somehow ignore the building and push it into the subsistence wage. Can we do this? EXPLAIN
% How do we ignoor buildings - when we talk about the land rents, we're calculating on the basis of the warranted rent wage premium- put people are paying for buildings.. - assume it comes out of the subistence wage- since this is just a theoretical treatment.-- but if you think about how much capital gain will you get, we'll also get capital gainso on the house piece which is not locational- just gains on that asset they happen to have.. --  looking at things coming from close toe the center ignoring what else. - tied together so market spreads capital gain over both of them, and the tax does the same too-- for locational advantage and services..

% Since the present value of rental income (OR NET RENTAL INCOME?) is the value of the house, i.e.,\\

In principle, the  sale price of a unit of land considered is the present discounted value of the stream of net rents. If $\mathcal{R}_N$ is one period rent, which is conventionally calculated as:
\begin{equation}
  P=\frac{\mathcal{R}_N}{r}  
\label{eq:Capitalization}
\end{equation}

%\[v= \delta(P^T- (1+r)M)    +\phi\mathcal{R}\]

% *** CLARIFY WHAT WE GET FROM INCLUDING $\psi$, and define, maybe compare with other shares like $\phi$.

% \noindent so we can write 

% \begin{align}  
%     V & = \delta \left((1+\dot P)  P_0- (1+r)mP_0 \right)  + \psi rP_0  \\
%       & =\left( \delta ((1+\dot P)  - (1+r)m)\  + \psi r\right)P_0
% \end{align}
%there are potetntilaly two interest ratex hereee - one used for capitaliÎ©ing rents to price, and one  is $r_i$. It may be sensibe to use the same value for both. Person I might be looking at the actual rents and using them to calculate the prtice it should sell for. If there is a real estate agent providing price information the tory may be different. SWe are really using htis for the expected value of the present value of net rent, and 

% This can be expressed in terms of the rate of return on the down payment, $V/D$
% \begin{align*}  
% v & = \frac{V}{D} \\
%   & = \left( \delta ((1+\dot P) - (1+r)m)\ + \psi r\right)P_0/D \\
%   & = \left( \delta ((1+\dot P) - (1+r)m)\ + \psi r\right) \frac{P_0}{P_0-mP_0} \\

% \subsection{REVISING and  Initializing the model}
\subsubsection{Housing prices} \label{section-housing-price}

A house offer two kinds of services - home services proper and locational services - access to the central city job. The value of a house then is the present discounted value of the flow of those services

Locational services are, on an annual basis $\omega- {c} * d$.

Housing services absorb about 30\% of income  we will use than number  as an approximation,  $a\psi$, where $a$ is the share of the subsistence wage and $\psi$


A property at $d$ offers the combined annual services of 

\begin{align}
h=\omega- {c} * d + a\psi  
\label{eqn-housing-price}
\end{align}

\ref{eqn}

and the value of the house is then the discounted value of the stream of services,
\[H=\frac{h}{r}\]

We will use this value as the price for the first period. 
 $P_0=\frac{\omega- {c} * d + a\psi}{r}$

This is what we can think of a  ``warranted price'', which exactly covers the actual value of the services. The warranted price  is not the same as the market price.  \textbf{The market price can depart from the warranted price} when there is price speculation based on expected future values or if agents make errors based on market information.

Annual rent charged initially is  equal to the value of services, $h$:
\[\mathcal R^{charged}= h= \omega- {c} * d + a\psi\]



\subsubsection{Annual Taxation}
Municipal taxes are based on the price of the house, $P_0=\omega- {c} * d + a\psi$ - usually with a lag, 

In each price a period a `mill rate'. Each mill is  expressed as  1/1,000 of the value is determines - The annual tax is initially

 $(taxrate)*P_0=(millrate)*\frac{\omega- {c} * d + a\psi}{r}$

This has to be compounded for decisions made over a period f more than one year.


\subsection{Distinguishing market rental price and locational rent}



Making these distinctions, we find that Equation C3 is wrong.

\begin{align}
\mathcal{R}_N &= \mathcal{R} - \mathcal{O} - \mathcal{T}
\end{align}

Why?  A tenant should expect to pay a market price for the combination of locational services and the services of land and buildings that they use.  It is an equilibrium market rent, not the economic locational rent economic rent. (The market can cause rents to diverge from this value. ) 

We should distinguish the locational rent from the $\mathcal{R}^l = \omega - {c}*d$ from the Warranted rental cost of housing services. (Maybe use a capital L?) 

Market  rental price $\mathcal{R}^w$ should  include the services of the house and land.  $\mathcal{R}^w =\mathcal{R}^l+\mathcal{R}^h$ 

There is another distinction: The warranted value is base on the true value of the services, while the market value can diverge. We do the calculation in terms of warranted values because we will use these to initialize the model. It might be better to use the subscript $m$ for `market'. 

For an investor, it is Net Warranted market  rental price that is relevant in decision making. For now, define (decide on the symbols you really want).
\begin{quotation}
a  =  share of subsistence wage  used for land and building e.g. 0.3

b  = share of share of subsistence wage  used on maintenance e.g. 0.2

c  = annual tax rate on rent and home  e.g. 12 mills = 0.012

\end{quotation}
Now Net Warranted market  rental price is
\begin{align}
\mathcal{R}_N^w &= \omega - {c}*d + a\psi -  \mathcal{O} - \mathcal{T} \\
\end{align}

It is also Net Warranted market  rental price that is relevant in taxation and maintenance. 

\begin{align}
\mathcal{O} &\equiv  ba\psi\\%Maintenance?
 \mathcal{T} &\equiv ca\psi %taxes?
\end{align}
so we can write
 \begin{align}
\mathcal{R}_N^w &= \omega - {c}*d- + a\psi -   ba\psi - ca\psi \\
\end{align}

% All of these are in annual values. We will use the present values  for the appropriate period  T in computations. (See notes on the present value calculations to use)

% \subsection{NEW WORK STARTS - How does this affect the bid price?}

% I now return to Equations B6 to compute the value of a proposed purchase


% \begin{align*}
% V &= \delta \left(P_T - (1+r)M\right) +      \mathcal{R}^w_N  \tag{B6} \\
%   &= \delta \left((1+\dot P)    - (1+r)m    \right) P^{bid} + \mathcal{R}^w_N%\label{eqn-property-investment-value1}
% \end{align*}
% Similarly, Equation B7 becomes

% \begin{align*}
% r_{return} = \frac{\delta \left(1 + \dot P - (1+r)m\right)}{1-m} + \frac{\mathcal{R}^w_N}{(1-m)^{bid}}\tag{B7}
% \end{align*}
% And following the same sequence of steps to derive the bid price 

% \begin{align*}
% P_i^{bid} \le &   \frac{\mathcal{R}^w_N}{(1-m_i)r_i^{target} - \delta_i \left(1 + L(P) - (1+r_i)m_i \right)} \tag{B10}\\
% 		 \le &   \frac{ \omega - {c}*d + a\psi -   ba\psi - ca\psi}{(1-m_i)r_i^{target} - \delta_i \left(1 + L(P) - (1+r_i)m_i \right)}	\\	
%    		 \le &   \frac{ \omega - {c}*d + a(1-b-c)\psi}{(1-m_i)r_i^{target} - \delta_i \left(1 + L(P) - (1+r_i)m_i \right)}	
% \end{align*}

%Our conclusion about the advantage that the bank and the wealthy have can be read out of this equation. 
%That may let us simplify the exposition in the financialization chapter.









We anchor our housing price expectations in bid rents, which, based on the literature can reasonably be seen as the equililbrium toward which prices will evolve. 


\section{Miscellaneous calculations about rates over time}

$delta(0)=1$  for funds received now

Lets calculate $S$, $\delta$ at time infinity:
*** Why?

\[\delta(t)=\left(\frac{1}{1+r}\right)^t\]



\begin{align}
delta (1)   &= 1/(1+r) \\
delta (t)   &= (1/(1+r))^t \\
delta (\infty)   &= \sum_0^\infty\left(1/(1+r)\right)^t\\ 
Let\ a=1/(1+r)&<1\\
delta (\infty)   &= \sum_0^\infty a^t\\ 
S               &= \sum_0^\infty a^t\\ 
               &= 1+a+a^2+a^3+a^4 \dots\\ 
S-aS             &= 1\\ 
S             &= 1/(1-a)\\ 
S             &= \frac{1}{1-\frac{1}{1+r}}\\ % subing r back in for a 
             &= \frac{1}{1-\frac{1}{1+r}}\\ 
             &= \frac{1}{\frac{1+r-1}{1+r}}\\ 
              &= \frac{1}{\frac{r}{1+r}}\\ 
             &= \frac{1+r}{r}
\end{align}
This is the case where you get paid at the beginning of the first period. Rent might be paid in advance for each month. .

For  the case where you get pay at the end of the first period. Interest on a loan  might be paid this way.  summing from t=1 this time, we get $S-aS =a$, and $S = a/(1-a)= \frac{1}{r}$. 

 

%\[\delta(t)= \delta(1)^t =\left(\frac{1}{1+r}\right)^t\]

Finally, we need an expression for the sum of a finite  series to T.  Doing the derivation to check my logic, notice that  omega, psi, c  and a are constants that can be factored out in the following,(\textbf{THIS IS THE WRONG PROPERTY VALUE}
%\[\left(c*\omega + c*a*\psi \right) ->c\left(\omega-trans\ d + a\psi \right)\]
\begin{align}%
    tax&= \sum_{t=0}^{T-1} \delta(t) \left(c*\omega + c*a*\psi \right)\\
        &= c(\omega + a\psi)\sum_{t=0}^T  \delta_t\\
        &= c(\omega + a\psi)(\delta_1+\delta_2 \dots \delta_T)\\
        &= c(\omega + a\psi) \left(\sum_0^\infty \delta_t-\sum_{T}^\infty \delta_t\right)\\
        &= c(\omega + a\psi) \left(\frac{1+r}{r}  - \left(\frac{1}{1+r}\right)^{T+1} \left(\frac{1+r}{r} \right) \right)\\
        &= c(\omega + a\psi) \frac{1+r}{r}\left(1  - \left(\frac{1}{1+r}\right)^{T+1} \right)
%      &=& c(\omega + a\psi)\delta_T\\
\end{align}


% \section{Other factors affecting price determination}
% \subsection{On bidding}


\section{The owner's decision to sell}
We will assume, at least initially, that for owners, deciding to sell is a life-cycle decision: home owners-workers  reach the end of their working lives, no longer need access to the central city, and put their homes on the market, making room for new workers to enter the urban market.\footnote{The timing decision can be randomized, but that is highly unlikely to affect results. On the other hand, 
\color{red}
if worker-owners remain in their homes after retirement, there are fewer homes available for new workers, which must produce a labour shortage in this model, driving up wages, leading to higher bids and rising home prices, which in turn attracts  speculative bidding. This will only accelerate any shift in the ownership pattern. Our core model suppresses labour market dynamics and the effect of housing shortages to focus on the warranted prices, which are driven by aggregation economies. 
\color{black}} 
\footnote{\color{blue}As a second step, we may allow potential buyers  to approach potential sellers who have not listed with an offer and allow worker-owners to consider retiring early or becoming tenants if an offer is attractive.  This is only likely if speculative pressures are strong. It may require having multiple institutional buyers to make offers more competitive. In that case initial offers will be closer to the maximum bid price, tending to pull prices up and benefit potential sellers.\color{black}}  

Worker-owners in the final few years of their working life may decide to  list if  they notice that the expected price posted by the real estate agent, $P^e$,  exceeds (say) 95\% of their reservation price. This is a `hopeful' listing, `fishing' for an offer that exceeds the actual reservation price.

\[P^{ask}>P^e> 0.95 P^r\] 

Otherwise
\[P^{ask}> 0.10P^r>P^e\] 



If no offer exceeds the reservation price, no sale is made.

Once an owner reached retirement age, if no sale is made the reservation price is reduced for the next cycle.

If no sale is made the owner considers becoming a landlord. if the present value of net rent is above the reservation price, the owner rents out the home. .

\section{Bargaining}


All agents have access to the price forecast, $P^e$, from the real estate agent.

We have five categories of potential buyers.\footnote{Types three and four  would  become landlords if the transaction is completed, which is a change of class status.} 
\begin{enumerate}
    \item newcomers to the city, who have a job offer  and seek to buy a home or become tenants.  
    \item financial investors who possess financial capital and seek a rate of return better than they would receive from alternative investments. We refer to this investor as `the bank'
    \item owner-occupiers who might mortgage their current homes  to purchase a revenue property
    \item owner-workers who retire and might  invest in a revenue property rather than spending  their capital gain 
    \item sellers are also default buyers, since they can buy their own home and rent it out if their \gls{reservation price} is not met.  
\end{enumerate}


For potential sellers the maximum bid price is also the `\gls{reservation price}' price.  
\[P^{ask}> P^r, \qquad   P^{offer}< P^{max}\]


All potential buyers and potential sellers  will calculate a \gls{maximum bid price} or reservation price and and an initial offer price or ask price \gls{bid  price}. 

The initial bid price (offer) will be lower than the potential buyers maximum bid price. The initial ask price will be higher than the reservation price.

Bargaining will occur when the maximum bid price of at least one agent exceeds the reservation price of the listing agent.

Transactions can occur when the maximum bid price of at least one agent exceeds the reservation price of the listing agent.


\subsection{Determining initial offer and ask prices}

Agents can calculate their maximum bid  or their  reservation price. 
These values are not public. We need to identify initial ask and offer prices, which is the way they appear in the market.


\[P^{ask}> P^r> P^e\] 

If the posted expected price exceeds their \gls{reservation price} they 
\begin{enumerate}
    \item list  the property for sale.with the real estate age,nt.
    \item select and asking price   
\end{enumerate}

The bank posts a \gls{maximum bid function} with the real estate agent.

In practice, potential investors will make an  initial  bid that is lower than this value and subsequent bargaining will settle of a price between the initial bid and the seller's asking price.

In the market, the initial bid should be smaller than the bid price calculated, which is a maximum that can earn the target rate of return, The bank will definitely go this high. 

If there is a  max bid among competing buyers, the second highest max bid should be the sale price, but the bidder with the highest max bid wins the property. This is realistic because in a bidding war the final bid only has to be a very small amount higher than that of the last competitor left.
That is the highest price that a seller can get.

 %This  seems realistic enough and is very simple to implement. It should producer a path that is indistinguishable form any more complex approach. 

% Will persons retiring who would leave the city invest in an urban rental?



% But what is $D$? Does the bank have unlimited funds? Isn't D just a fraction of P?  If so it cancels out
% r is the prime rate- that the bank pays? 




\chapter{Relating the bid price parameters to the code}

% \begin{verbatim}
% \end{verbatim}

In the following sections we discuss % the computation of agents' bid price, outline potential discounting approaches, and discussing 
how each component of the calculation is treated in the code, organizing the discussion following Equation~\ref{eqn-bid-price2}:


\begin{align}
P_i^{bid} \le   \frac{\mathcal{R}_N}{(1-m_i)r_i^{target}- \delta_i \left(1+L(P)- (1+ r_i)m_i\right)}.
\end{align}
Net rent, $\mathcal{R}_N$, is discussed in section \ref{SS:NetRent}. 

Interest rates, discount rates, and borrowing ratios are discussed in section \ref{SS:RatesAndRatios},
The borrowing ratio, $m_i$, is discussed in section \ref{SS:BorrowingRatio}, the target interest rate, $r_i^{target}$, is discussed in \ref{SS:targetr} the discount factor, $\delta_i$ is discussed in section \ref{SS:discountfactor}. The price approximation mechanism, $L(P)$ is discussed in \ref{SS:PriceForecast}, and the interest rate the buyer has to pay for the mortgage, $r_i$, is discussed in \ref{SS:BankRate}. Sections are thus numbered: 

\begin{align*}
P_i^{bid} \ge   \frac{\ref{SS:NetRent}} {(1-\ref{SS:BorrowingRatio})\ref{SS:targetr}-

\section{Net rent}\label{SS:NetRent}
We assume that the present value of the rent % $\mathcal{R}$ 
is known to an investor in advance. We can imagine the investors' accountant having information on the rent that the market will bear or on prior rents and including this information in the calculation of $P^{bid}$.

Uncertainty can be represented as bias or stochasticity.
Calculation notes: I have rent from the wages. I have kappa and sigma from our ex parameter values. . omega from the wages. 

Net rent, which can be written a share, $\phi$ of total rent $\mathcal{R}_N = \phi \mathcal{R}$
$\mathcal{R}_N = \phi \mathcal{R}$

Where the \gls{rent share}, phi is a fraction
$\phi = (rent-taxes-costs) /rent$ 

There's a distinction between the warranted rent, the net rent, and the rent that's actually charged.

We assume that the  rent  actually charged to a tenant is the warranted economic rent, ($\mathcal{R}= \omega - {c} d_j$), but the relevant term to enter into the calculation of return on investment is the net rent $\mathcal{R}_N$ for a given property, because the returns are the returns an investor can get after paying taxes and operating costs.

In our computational model, we do the calculation in terms of a mortgage, so we want the total returns after expenses, in present value, compounded over the mortgage  period.
% We want the total returns after expenses, in present value, compounded over a 5 year period.

\begin{align}
\mathcal{R}_N &= \mathcal{R} - \mathcal{O} - \mathcal{T} 
\end{align}

In terms of the warranted rent, 
\begin{align}
\mathcal{R}_N &= (1-\kappa_j - \sigma_j)(\omega - {c} d_j)
\end{align}


% $\mathcal{R}_N = (1-\kappa_j - \sigma_j) (\omega - {c} d_j)$

% {\color{red}
% Notice that  we need here is really the fraction of the warranted rent that the owner gets to keep after maintenance costs and taxes. It is possible that the owner is charging more or less than the economic  rent, but economic rent can be seen as an equilibrium value. Economic rent is $\mathcal{R}$.  This is (tautologically) related to the price as a fraction of the actual sale price: COULD MOVE TO THE CHAPTER NOW SINCE THE THE SECTION IS MOVED THER
% }
% \[\mathcal{R}= \frac{\mathcal{R}}{P_0}P_0 \]

If we want to know the  present value  of the \textbf{net rent}, $\mathcal{R}_N$  collect over the period  $T$, $\mathcal{R}_N^T$, we \textbf{add up} the discounted rents for each year. We may assume the rents are rising at and that the first is the current warranted rent, which gives us a computational formula. 
\[\mathcal{R}_N^T= (\omega-{c}*d)\sum_{t=0}^{t=T-1} \frac{(1+\dot{\mathcal{R}})^{t}} {(1+r_{r_\delta})^{t+1}} \]

% \[\mathcal{R}_Nj^T= (\omega-{c}*d_j)\sum_{\tau=0}^{\tau=T-1}\left[\frac{1+\dot{\mathcal{R}}}{1+r_{r_\delta}}\right]^\tau \]
\noindent where $\dot{\mathcal{R}}$ is an expected rate of change of rents - possibly zero for now, and $r_\delta$ is the individual's discount rate. 

TODO: problem - how to handle subscripts with net rent $\mathcal{R}_N$


\subsection{Tax ratio}\label{SS:TaxRatio} 
The tax ratio $\sigma$ is the share of rents that the municipality takes for services and infrastructure. This fraction of the value of the property is about 30\% based on mill rates in Ontario,  so $\sigma = 0.3$. % REFERENCE

*** CHECK Total taxes paid on  property $j$, over a given mortgage period $T$ is 

\[\Psi_j^T = \psi * \mathcal{R}\].

\subsection{Cost tax ratio}\label{SS:CostRatio} 
The value of $\kappa$  varies for every property based on maintenance requirements, historic rents, tenant rights, and variations in assessed values. If it varies, it may be useful as a quality indicator.

%Values for $\kappa$ and $\sigma$ must be adjusted to take into account the length of the period or net rents have to be summed over the period.  NO LONGER NEEDED 

Nothing prevents $\sigma+\kappa >1$, which would leave an investor unable to cover building maintenance and taxes out of current rent. 


\section{Income andj wealth matter}
\subsection{Interest rates, discount rates and borrowing ratios} \label{SS:RatesAndRatios}

According to the Canada Housing Statistics Program (CHSP), first time home buyers require a combination of sufficient income and savings in order to enter the housing market. (insert tables? from the CHSP?) We have implemented these facts by making interest rates and mortgage share depend on income and wealth.

% Investors now make up more than 25\% of Ontario homebuyers, pushing prices higher, experts warn. 2020

% Released: 2022-04-12

% New data from the Canadian Housing Statistics Program (CHSP) show the extent of inequalities in housing: multiple-property owners possess nearly one-third of all residential properties and the top 10\% wealthiest owners account for around one-quarter of residential housing value. Despite these inequalities, new data show an increase in the number of first-time home buyers from 2018 to 2019.
% Both income and housing wealth are concentrated at the top, even among owners. When ordering individual owners by their yearly incomes, the top 10% of owners in Ontario and British Columbia each had yearly incomes above $125,000.
 

\subsection{Borrowing ratio} \label{SS:BorrowingRatio}
$m_i$

The borrowing ratio, $m_i$, is just the fraction of the price that the bank will lend to a potential buyer. \textbf{It may depend on the individual.} 

Income(\ref{SS:YWealthConstraint}) and/or wealth (\ref {SS:MWealthConstraint}) may constrain individual participation in markets. 
Here we should use the same logic as we use about the interest rate charged. (\ref{SS:BorowingRate})

It is likely to be higher for institutional buyers  and for the wealthy because the bank thinks those with assets are more secure risks. they may have other assets that could be attached in the case of default.
(note interventions with reduces interest rates, or loan assessments drawing on techniques used by foundations could have value)


\subsection{Target interest rate}\label{SS:targetr}

 The target interest rate, $r^{target}$, is the prime rate plus a margin. % required by the bank.  Question: do non-bank actors have such a term?

\begin{verbatim}
self.get-target-interest-rate(buyer)
\end{verbatim}



\subsection{Discount factor}\label{SS:discountfactor}

The discount factor $\delta_i$ for THE END OF period $T$ captures the cost of waiting $T$ periods to sell the property. The usual way to treat it, which we use here, is to assume that $i$ has an interest rate $r_i$ and has been investing efficiently. This means that  the individual has a discount factor for future returns based on the year-over-year rate of return. 

\[\delta^T_i=\left[\frac{1}{1+r_i}\right]^T\]



\subsection{Price forecast approximation} \label{SS:PriceForecast}
$L(p)$

$p$ is all the price data plus any exogenous information (e.g. policy knowledge?). $L(p)$ is an estimation function that produces a `common knowledge' value for the rate of price increase. Later you can add idiosyncratic extra knowledge or extra ignorance.

\subsection{Prime interest rate}\label{SS:BankRate}
$r$

The bank's interest rate, $r$, is just the bank rate (prime rate? set by the Bank of Canada. Exogenous. Just assign  a value like 4\%.

\subsection{Wealth constraint on m} \label{SS:MWealthConstraint}

We can define individual wealth as:
\[W_i= P_i -M_i  +S_i\]
where 

\begin{tabular}{ll}
$P_i$ & value of owned home\\
$M_i$ & Mortgage on owned home\\
$S_i$ & personal savings = $age*d*W$\\
\end{tabular}

The availability of capital differs for rich and poor. 


We can develop an expression to capture the relationship between the \gls{borrowing ratio}, $m_i$,  and individual wealth. Figure~\ref{Fig:Borrowingratio} illustrates a mortgage availability  model that is written:

 \[ m_i = \frac{0.1 \left(9-\left(\frac{W_i}{\bar W}\right)^{0.5}l\right)}{2} \]

 
Where $\bar{W}$ is mean wealth and $W_i$ is individual wealth. 
The relationship is clearly established empirically \cite{}, but location and shape of the curve may vary somewhat. The curve is parameterized, here, so that the bank has a borrowing ratio close to one, perhaps 0.9, since it has many assets. The borrowing ratio for the median wealth holder, perhaps 0.8.

 The median after-tax income of Canadian families and unattached individuals was \$66,800Â inÂ 2020 according to Statistics Canada's %\href{https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/daily-quotidien/220323/dq220323a-eng.htm}{Canadian Income Survey, 2020}.  \href{https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/t1/tbl1/en/tv.action?pid=1110005501}
 Data released in 2020 by Statistics Canada indicates that the top 1\% of Canadians made, on average, around \$512,000 in a single year \cite{stats-can-canadian-incomes}. % \href{https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/daily-quotidien/201222/dq201222b-eng.htm}{Survey of Financial Security, 2019}.

 A study by Statistics Canada found that the typical Canadian household now has a median net worth of \$329,900, while the average net worth in Canada is \$738,200 \cite{stats-can-median-net-worth}.  %\href{https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/t1/tbl1/en/tv.action?pid=1110005501}{High income tax filers in Canada}

\subsubsection{Computing the income constraint on interest rates}\label{SS:YWealthConstraint}
$r_i$

In our model, we  tie the individual cost of capital,  $r_i$ for agent $i$, to a prime rate, $\bar r$ or the bank's target rate, $r^{target}$, prime plus 1\%, say. and to individual wealth. Figures~\ref{Fig:Borrowingrate1} and ref{Fig:Borrowingrate1} illustrate a couple of possible  cost-of-borrowing models roughly consistent  with the stylized facts about lenders. 

\begin{align}
 r_i =  &  \left(A + B \frac{\bar{W}}{W_i}\right) \bar r       \label{eq:incomeandr1}  \\
 r_i =  &  \left(\bar r - A + B *\frac{\bar W}{W_i - C}\right) \label{eq:incomeandr2}  \\
\end{align}
Where $\Bar{W}$ is mean wealth and $W_i$ is individual wealth. In Equation~\ref{eq:incomeandr2},  A determines y-shift, B, the scale, and C the  x-shift for the curve.

The rates $\delta,\ \sigma,$ and $r$ depend on the period, $T$. 

\subsection{Incorporating growth and discounting}
%We need a time period T for calculations. For use in any calculation, 

With a price-growth rate of $\dot P$ per year, the growth over $T$ years is $(1+\dot P)^T$, and  %and a 5 year mortgage period, 
the expected price at the end of the period is:

\[P^e_T=P_0(1+\dot P)^T\]

If, for example price growth is 10\%, $\dot P= 0.1$, the {capital gain}, or growth, over a 5-year mortgage term is 0.61051 $\approx$ 60\% of the original price, $P_0$.

If we want the compounded interest rate person $i$ the term T,
\[r_i^T=(1+r_i)^T\]
% This is the value we use in equation~\ref{EqBidPrice}.

If person $i$  discounts at a discount rate $r^\delta$, the present value of a receipt at time $t$ is calculated by using the \textbf{discount factor} $\delta_i^T$.

\[\delta_i^T= \left( \frac{1}{1+r_\delta} \right)^T \]
%\[\delta_i^T= \sum_{\tau=0}^{\tau=T}\left( \frac{1}{1+r_\delta} \right)^\tau \]
 
These can be combined into a function %\delta that  gives a single discounting factor  for a value  like future price that is both growing and being discounted over several (T) periods:
\[ PDV(P^e_T)=P_0\left( \frac{1+\dot P}{1+r_\delta} \right)^T \]
This PDV function specifically combines any expected rent increase, the individual's discount rate and the mortgage term into a single operation.

\subsection{Mortgage availability}
For home loans, many personal finance experts recommend total housing costs account for less than 28\% of your \textbf{gross} household income, This gives us an \textbf{income-based  mortgage maximum} of \[M^{max}_Yi = \frac{0.28*(\omega+w)}{r_i}\] It is the maximum the bank will let you pay.

We assume $r_i$ is based on the individual's assets, on relative wealth. Where is it calculated for the householder or the bank?

We get a \textbf{price-based mortgage maximum} \[M^{max}_P = 0.8P_0\] where $P_0$ is the actual sale price. This is based on the maximum amount of risk that the bank is willing to take on. ($P_0$  will not always be the same as the asking price or the warranted price.)

Notation: 
Agent counts and indices are subscripts.
Values related to time are superscripts, time as a continuous 
variable is small, a period is capitalized e.g. the period $T$ of some number of years. 
In general values are capitals, rates are small letters.


\section{Additional Assumptions}
\begin{enumerate}
\item There is full employment, no frictional unemployment, and no labour adjustment costs.
\item Firms set output and factor inputs to maximize profits, so factors are paid the value of their marginal private product
\item Demand for output is perfectly elastic (constant price = 1)
\end{enumerate}


Rural producers pay a wage $\psi$. this covers a standard house, lot, entertainment, diet and consumption pattern. We  choose units so that per-period cost of a unit of productive capital is also $\psi$
