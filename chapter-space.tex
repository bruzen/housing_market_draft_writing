\chapter{Urban Land and Land Rent}

\section{The Alonzo-Jacobs Model}
In 1964, William Alonso published \textbf{Location and Land Use}, in which he described a model that specifically linked the urban wage premium to urban land rents and  became the central model in modern urban economics. 
We use an \textbf{Alonzo-Jacobs model} to explore the source and distribution surplus value, where the reference to Jane Jacobs links the wage premium to Jacobs-style  agglomeration effects that generate urban productivity.% and the wage premium. 

Ricardo had described a model with a central market for corn, producing corn took land and transporting corn to market was costly. Because there is one market price for corn, land with low transportation costs near the central market earns a rent. More distant land has lower value. In Alonzo's model there is central market and a single price for labour, producing labour takes land, and transporting labour to the market is costly. Alonzo simply re-presents Ricardo's conception of rent  mathematically for a different social system and production technology.  

The logic of the model is illustrated in the following figure. The height of the green bar on the left illustrates the premium for urban labour at the centre of an Alonzo circular city. The height red triangle at the left is the rent earned on land at the centre, which has no transportation costs.\footnote{The model says nothing about who gets the rent in the urban economy. For classical economists it was obvious that the agricultural rents went to the class of land-owners.} Transportation to and from the center costs $t$ times the distance $d$ from the center. Fuel, capital, and time costs are  all included in $t$.

% %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% PARTITIONING THE LABOUR SHARE
The entire rectangle, $\omega$ $\times$ $d^*$, is the surplus generated by urban agglomeration. Urban land rent, which is the residual when transport costs are deducted from the wage premium, declines  with distance $d$ until, at the very edge of the city, $d^*$, t the cost of transportation  consumes the entire wage. Property values are simply the the present discounted value of the rent at any point.

At the bottom of the figure we illustrate the conventional `subsistence wage'  earned by a worker whether in the city or outside of the city.   In most analyses of urban spaces this living wage is simply ignored, since it is the wage premium that generates rents.  It is also common to assume that the labour market and production at the centre takes no space.   


Workers are attracted to the city by the wage premium, $\omega$,  which represents the share of the surplus generated by the city that goes to labour.  The grey triangle represents the amount of the surplus dissipated in travel costs.  

The extent  of the city  $d^*$ is a simply the distance at which total $rt$ transportation cost  is equal to the wage premium
\[d^* t= \omega\]
where $t$ is the unit cost of transportation. In the figure, $-t$ is the slope of the diagonal line dividing rent from transportation expenditure.



 \section{Implications and results from Alonzo's Circular City}
 It is a beautifully simple model that accounts for many features of urban structure and urban history. In this section we describe some of the insights supported by the model. Extensions can incorporate variation in wages, density, transportation costs,  preference, and even building technology and codes. The limitations of the simple, continuous, equilibrium based versions described above can be overcome using agent-based models to model the evolution of complex and much more realistic urban systems. 

 \subsection{The magnitude of Rents and transportation costs}
 From $w$, $t$ and population density we can derive population, wage bill, total rent, transportation costs. The figure above suggest that  half of the urban surplus is spent on transportation, but because the city is circular, the total value of rents can be represented as the volume  \[ V=\frac{1}{3}\pi  d^{*2} \omega \]
of a cone with radius $d^*$ and  height $\omega = td^*$. Substituting out either  $\omega$ or  $d^*$, we find that total rent is  proportional to the \textbf{cube} of either  $d^*$ or $\omega$. 

The total value of wage payments would appear as the volume of cylinder enclosing the cone\footnote{since the wage is the same for each unit of labour no matter where is t is produced (resides).}.  
$V=\pi r^2 \omega$

and total transport costs are 
$\frac{2}{3}\pi  d^{*2} \omega).$
With uniform density, population is proportional to the square of  $d^{*2}$ while rents and  transportation costs are proportional to the cube. 

\subsection {Changing Transportation Costs}



 It is easy to see that the transportation cost revolution brought about by first street cars and later automobiles made much larger cities possible.  It also affected social structure and left indelible marks of the form of cities developing at the time and after.In North America, with large amounts of land, it generated massive urban sprawl, but also made land available for a growing `middle class.' Ultimately it generated congestion and rising transportation cost that began to limit urban growth. 

\section{Adding Jacobs-style agglomeration effects}
Rising urban productivity will raise the wage, attracting more workers. If they are added in suburbs at the edge of the city (Ricardo's extensive margin) virtually all of the wage premium they receive is dissipated in transportation costs. Closer to the centre,  land rents rise. Owner-occupiers capture the increase as property value appreciation. Tenants are likely to be faced with higher rents.      

If agglomeration is the source of productivity gains, however, the new workers increase the urban premium, further increasing land values and attracting more workers. 



\section{Class structure}\label{Sec:ClassStucture}TO THE ALONZO CHAPTER

At the stage illustrated in Figure~\ref{Fig:Rent1},  (Alonzo city suburbanized with owner occupiers) the model has three spatially segregated ``classes.'' Capitalists live in some spaceless utopia, urban workers commuting and earning wages $\omega + w$ reside in the urban commuter-shed and  %There may be a band surrounding the city or persons who do not commute but enjoy urban consumption amenities. 
The rural population consists of uniformly distributed efficient mix of rural capital producers and workers, all of whom receive $\omega$.%\footnote{This does nothing but fix the price of produced capital in terms of the rural wage.} 



 Owners of urban firms are  conventional  capitalists, who may earn excess profit if they can capture an unearned surplus from labour.  Any unearned surplus increases the return to urban capital relative to rural capital, resulting in continuous expansion of the urban economy. Continuous growth in turn results in continuously rising urban land prices and hence housing costs. We ignore the distributional implications of this feature of the model, and focus instead on the part of value produced by the city that appears as land rent. 
  
\section{Net Land Rent} TO THE ALONZO CHAPTER
The 
The simple graphical model we consider above is revealing, but it leaves out many important features of the urban system. The only costs included are the transportation costs for the individual.  Since urban services and  a substantial fraction of urban amenities are financed through the public sector a more complete model must include both servicing costs and property taxation. The relevant rent profile from an economic point of view is NET of all service costs. From a finance point of view it is net of tax liabilities.

Two stylized facts should be noticed. The first is that the marginal cost of servicing generally  rises with the distance from the centre.  Figure~\ref{} illustrates the general form of servicing costs, but not  the relative scales of rent and servicing costs. When this observation is combined with the `Henry George Theorem" () the conclusion is that the optimal size of the city  is at  $d^{**}$, where marginal service cost intersects with the marginal increase in total urban rent. 


The second stylized fact  is that property taxes, which are generally  fixed as a share of property value, decline as the distance from the centre increases.Figure~\ref{} illustrates the general form of tax liabilities, although it does not  accurately represent their relationship top rent or  servicing costs.  This implies that in many or most urban situations the residents at the outer edges pay less than the average amount in property tax per unit of land, but cost  the community budget more than the average amount. In essence, the central city subsidizes the suburbs. (ref Perverse Cities}  This arrangement is both economically inefficient and unfair, but it has been built into the fiscal structure of cities largely as a result of automobile-based urban growth. It is likely that this fiscal misallocation saps some of the potential productivity growth of cities.

Both effects are more variable and than the simple model suggests.  One  conclusion urban theorists draw based on variants of the Alonzo model is that because property owners in the low-density urban margin are subsidized,  the subsidy is likely to create serious fiscal problems for municipalities in the long term and result in serious inefficiency in land use.
