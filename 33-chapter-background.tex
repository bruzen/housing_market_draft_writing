\chapter{Gather for INTRO}

This study is fairly simply a an exploration of the impact of financialization of the housing market, and what that means for urban productivity.

link to productivity

\subsection{What we need to do}
% That sounds more simple than it is because to 
to achieve that, we need actually to 

1. build a model housing market for a city. 

2. And we have to, therefore have an urban model. 

3. And we have to figure out what it is that's at stake in the financialization which turns out to be land rents. And that means the city has to bring together essentially classical land rent theory, modern urban theory and the economics and bidding processes in a housing market. THIS IS THE MAIN PIECE, DO WE  NEED ALL IN THIS LIST?

4. And then it has to keep track of some macro variables that are significant for policy. 


This matters because, % thinking about housing markets and what was going on in Ontario, and around the world,
cities are going through a great transformation of ownership structures. 




\subsection{The research gap}
 but we don't have the tools to understand the implications of integrate it into formal theory.
 
 There's lots of work on causes.

Who claims those benefits, and what does that mean for productivity and the future of cities?

Our analysis suggests  it actually has  implications for the success of cities. % and of socieities, the future of a middle class, and whether citiec can continue to generate value. 


Cities are essential - draw on bettencourt/west's case,
Geoffrey West has argued that ``Cities are the crucible of civilization, the hubs of innovation, the engines of wealth creation and centers of power, the magnets that attract creative individuals, and the stimulant for ideas, growth, and innovation.'' \cite{westScaleUniversalLaws2017} 
Jane Jacobs talks about the vibrancy of cities, and their central role as the source of productivity.

 Cities are particularly central to productivity.

\chapter{COMBINE WITH RENT Background} \label{chapter-background}

% There are two dominant stories of \gls{distribution} in economics. The first and oldest is based on the classical concept of rent as explained  by David Ricardo \cite{ricardoEssayInfluenceLow1815}, in which owners of an asset are able to extract a value beyond what they contribute based on their ownership of a scarce resource. 
% The second is the marginalist approach, developed by Clark and others, in which workers and other factors  in competitive markets receive the \gls{marginal value-product} of their contribution to production. 

% Both developed in response to the specific social and economic conditions of the periods in which they emerged. Both attempt to explain where the output of society ended up within society. they are, at their heart, stories of who  claims what share of production.  Classical rent theory  emphasized the distribution of the social surplus, the part of production  over and above what was needed to reproduce society. This included only land rents initially, but was extended to the distribution of profit profits.   These are exactly the types of surplus income that are not explained by the neoclassical theory, which is  awkward because profits and rents form a substantial part of national income (20â€“25 percent) in the world the neoclassical model describes. In this thesis we identify classical rents intn the urban systems and exxamine their distribution.. 
% % ***E FIRSTNAME Ricardo was a INSERT NATIONALITY classical economist  in the WHICH Century. 

%Classical economics emerged in the 16$^{th}$ and 17$^{th}$ centuries at a time of exploding colonial wealth. In this period,  European economies were still structured largely around agricultural production in which farmers OR peasants work the land  owned by the descendants of feudal aristocrats. Urban economies based around factories were just beginning to emerge as significant drivers of wealth.\footnote{The Industrial Revolution is usually described as beginning around 1760 and having significantly transformed society by about 1820â€“1840.} % It was only after 1650 that living standards in the UK did start to increase for a sustained period. Before the modern era of economic growth, the economy worked very differently. Not technological progress, but the size of the population determined the standards of living.} 
In this economic context, the agricultural surplus is captured by feudal aristocrats. 

%As WHAT LED TO THE EXPLOSION... CHANGES IN UNIVERSITIES OR THE ECONOMY, there was an explosion of thinking about social and economic structures and systems.  This was a period where a range of thinkers explored many ideas to explain the shifting social and economic conditions. 

%Distribution, or who got what share of production was a central concern. This focus came to the forefront in the 1600s and 1700s as colonial expansion of land holdings, factories and supplied change concentrated wealth- funding investment in the arts and sciences, great fortunes - harsher conditions for farmers, pushed of their land with enclosures, and concentrated in urban factories, almost exclusively poor with - illness bad working conditions % 90 rural,-- population snap shot % (unprecedented in northern Europe, a relative backwater) --  %gt (new ineuqlity- jusxtabosition- fortuioned unpreciendet ont hat content to rivla hsotori great- wons- woth workers dying, kids in factories- Dickens period, pesantry.. - both were new- the eilsure- )
% and concerned with inequality, which suited a time in which the labourers both on the land, and in the emerging factories struggled with poverty, at a time of rapidly growing -
% -the intense interest spiked as wealth grew in colonial Europe. %(reformation another answer to this)
% NOTABLY THIS WAS AN URBAN TRANSITION- FARMS TO SUBURBS- POWER GROWTH, AN INFLECTION - LIKE COVID REVEALED THE NEW FORM WITH A RAPID MOBILITY CHANGE..
% The new form is the urban
% dense exchange - experience in person density can compete with screen experience -

%In this context, Ricardo refined the classical concept of rent.  

% ***E Today the word rent is usually used to refer to payments made by a tenant to a landlord to for the right to occupy a property, but this is not the traditional economic concept of  rent.  

% ***E As a concept, it's more closely related to profit / surplus than to rent paid for properties. 


% ***E NEED TO ADD HOW DOES THIS CONTRIBUTE OR EQUATE TO A THEORY OF DISTRIBUTION... WHAT DOES IT EXPLAIN...
%Ricardo's concept of rent accounted for the way that.... WHAT IT DESCRIBED. 
%This remains important to understanding distribution in general because.....


%The marginalist account describes how workers receive the marginal value of their contribution to production. THIS MEANS.....
%It formalizes what classical economist Adam Smith describes in the story of the pin factory. (EXPLAIN PIN FACTORY)

%The marginalist account of distribution gave a story of production that seemed to align with the rising fortunes of workers following WWII, in the 1950s and 1960s when it came to dominate. 

%This narrative dominates in neo-classical economics, particularly in the United States, and formed the basis of conventional micro-economics training. (EVEN NOW OR WHEN)
%It was also influential in shaping public discourse and policy in the early 20th century. For example, because it implies WHAT THAT MEANS MONOPOLY IS BAD... it provided the intellectual foundation for anti-monopoly political movements in the early 20th century.

\textbf{These two stories each reflect a distinct dominant mode of production}, period in society, and methodological set of tools available.From the Classical to Neo-Classical economic approaches, we also see development in the methodological approaches to describing economies. In Ricardo's era, economics was characterized by a free flowing descriptive approach characterized by wide debate, and many concepts explored. By the the time the marginalist approach emerged, new mathematical approaches were beginning to emerge OR dominate the economic discourse. 

SUMMARIZE THE DIFFERENCE IN WHAT EACH MODEL TELLS US ABOUT DISTRIBUTION. WHAT IS OVERALL DIFFERENT, WHAT DIFFERENT INSIGHTS EMERGE. 

\section{This Work}

\textbf{This thesis contributes to a third theory} % ***E IS THIS RIGHT?? I CHANGED IT TO THEORy OF DISTRIBUTION FROM THEORY OF MODERN URBAN RENT WHICH IS NOT THE CATEGORY WE ARE DISCUSSEING THEORIES FOR SO IT DOESNT MAKE SENES
of distribution by developing a theory of modern urban rent which integrates the classical descriptive work on rent and the neoclassical marginalist approach, with modern work on the scaling of wealth in cities. 

Just as the classical and neo-classical approaches \textbf{responded to and theorized the dominant mode of production in their time,} the theoretical framework emerging now, responds to the economic and social factors that are defining this period.  The early stories of production from thinkers like Ricardo centred on exploring who claimed the surplus from agricultural production Over time, the story moved to industrial production. Now the center of production is increasingly  WHAT KIND OF WORK (% ***E SAYING IT IS URBAN CHANGES THE SUBJECT TO LOCATION FROM TYPE OF WORK).
Industrialization shifted the centres of wealth to cities and since then the economic importance of cities has only grown. (%***E IS THIS SO?).

WHAT IS TANGIBLY HAPPENING IN CITIES THAT MAKES THEM SO IMPORTANT? WHAT KIND OF WORK?

WHAT DOES SOCIAL WEALTH MEAN?


A theory of production that doesn't center/involve the relation between cities and production/urban space and human capacity simply can't explain the creation of value in the modern world. It will miss WHAT SPECIFICALLY 

This is why is useful to draw in urban theory and spatial models (OR WHAT)

While econimists have focused on, URBAN THEORY has developed accoutns of WHAT????
WHAT ARE THE MAOR ACCOUNTS YOU ARE DRAWING ON? 
Meanwhile, while economists have focused on WHAT, Urban Theory has explored a different set of questions. 
WHAT DOES URBAN THEORY STUDY? WHAT KINDS OF QUESTIONS. 

This work weaves traditional economic approaches together with urban theory to contribute to a picture of distribution that accounts for how modern modern social and economic trends play out in space (FIX THIS SENTENCE)
ALSO ADD: 
key thinkers - is anyone else building the broader picture of this third story?? if not say something like "the key insights to this work have been developed separately in these different fields, this thesis pulls them into an singular account of distribution in the the current period. 


This approach also draws on the advancing\textbf{ methodological tools available}. The early classical work could reflect rich dynamic stories with many dimensions, using qualitative methods % ***E CAN YOU SAY QUALITATIVE METHODS??? I WANT TO EMPHASIZE THE DIFFERENCE IN METHODS MORE
