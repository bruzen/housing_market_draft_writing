The model with begins a simple observation - that people are more productive in cities. This is an observation that was explored by Sir William Arthur Lewis (1915 -- 1991)  \emph{Economic Development with Unlimited Supplies of Labour} described a model 
\cite{Lewis1954EconomicDW}. Lewis received the Nobel Prize in Economics in 1979, (sharing it with Theodore Schultz) for  ``pioneering research into economic development research with particular consideration of the problems of developing countries." The observation implies that labour will move from the countryside to cities.  Graphically we could present the situation that Lewis analyzed as follows

This essay  is written in the classical tradition, making the classical assumption, and asking the classical question. The classics, from Smith to Marx,  all  assumed,  or argued, that an unlimited supply of labour was available at subsistence wages. They then enquired how production grows through time. They found the answer in capital accumulation, which they explained in terms of their analysis of the distribution of income. Classical systems thus determined simultaneously   income distribution and income growth, with the relative prices of commodities as a  minor bye-product.

The purpose of this essay is thus to see what  can be made of the classical  framework  in  solving  problems of distribution, accumulation, and growth, first in a closed and then in an open economy.
