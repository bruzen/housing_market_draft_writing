\chapter{Initial values} \label{appendix-parameters}

% Here are the parameters as they appear in the code. 
These are the values passed to the program on initialization.  Some are initial values for endogenous variables, %These are {initial values} that we calculate based on the parameters above. These initial values 
% providing a starting point consistent with the production theory. 
for instance `\texttt{init\_F},' `\texttt{init\_n},' and `\texttt{init\_k};' %are initial values, adjusted as the model iterates. 
some, like ``output for a typical rural firm,'' are intermediate variables used in further calculations;  % that have to be chosen because they are used in calculating other values are:
and some are parameters.  While parameters typically remain constant through the run, experiments can perturb them. For instance, introducing a forcing function driving the `\texttt{price\_of\_output}' is a natural way to model the effect of business cycles on firm production. 
%notice that there is an indent on every line that must be removed 
% Details of the adjustment speeds and parameter setting are not discussed here because they have to be `tuned'. The parameter space of the model is large, and cities only exist in a sub-region of the space. For example, if the marginal product of labour is too low, cities cannot exist. If it is too high the city explodes. We have identified a region with plausible values in which city behaviour corresponds to what we know about the evolution of cities.
