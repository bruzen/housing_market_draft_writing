We are considering market in which one good is desired  both for its use-value, $h$, and as a financial asset\footnote{ In many advanced economies, the average annual real return on housing assets between 1950 and 2015 lies between 5 percent and 8 percent, comparable in magnitude to that of equity investment but with a lower standard deviation (Jord\'a and others 2017) From IMF’s Global Financial Stability Report – April 2018}.   We need to work out the return on housing as an asset for a homeowner. We can treat the rental price, p, as the cost of the services from a unit it of housing. The market price of a unit of housing  should then be the present value of the housing services plus the present value of the expected price appreciation. 
\section{Individual choice}

The rate of return on housing is an element of household choice. A household chooses how much housing on any sort on offers is optimal. If the housing is purchased the return enters the lifetime budget constraint. The rental-ownership choice is made by selecting the alternative unit with the highest lifetime utility,. 

The life cycle hypothesis provides a simple way to integrate assets into housing market behaviour, so we assume the life cycle hypothesis holds for this person.\footnote{Modigliani, Franco, and Richard H. Brumberg, 1954, “Utility analysis and the consumption function: an interpretation of cross-section data,” in Kenneth K. Kurihara, ed., Post- Keynesian Economics, New Brunswick, NJ. Rutgers University Press. Pp 388–436.} In the simple case without discounting, she divides lifetime earned income, $\sum_t{Y_t}{T}$, and non-income wealth, $W$, equally over the remaining $T$ years of her life.  
    \[C = \frac{W+\sum_tY_t}{T}.\]

A low marginal propensity to consume out of financial assets is consistent with Poterba and Samwick\footnote{Poterba, J. and A. Samwick, Stock Ownership Patterns, Stock Market Fluctuations and Consumption, Brookings Papers on Economic Activity, 1995, 2, 295–357.}. They examine luxury good demand when stock prices rise, and their results find sensitivity only in the automobile market, leading Shleifer\footnote{Shleifer, A., Comment on ‘‘Stock Ownership Patterns, Stock Market Fluctuations and Consumption,’’ Brookings Papers on Economic Activity, 1995, 2, 358–59.} to suggest that the marginal propensity to consume from stock market wealth is negligible. Engelhardt\footnote{Engelhardt, G. V., House Prices and Home Owner Saving Behavior, Regional Science and Urban Economics, 1996, 26, 313–36} finds that housing wealth can have a large though asymmetric impact on consumption. Households reduce consumption by as much as 30 cents for a one dollar decline in house equity. However, when house equity increases, the impact on consumption is negligible. Case, Quigley and Shiller\footnote{Case, K. E., J. M. Quigley and R. J. Shiller, Comparing Wealth Effects: The Stock Market Versus the Housing Market, Cambridge, MA: National Bureau of Economic Research, Working Paper 8606, 2001.} found that for housing wealth of \$1 increase in house prices (with mortgage debt constant) results in a consumption increase of 5 cents to 9 cents in the current year.

We follow the classic  Ando and Modigliani paper and let the consumption in each period be a different but fixed fraction of lifetime wealth, $\Omega_t$.\footnote{Ando, Albert, and Franco Modigliani, 1963, “The ‘life-cycle’ hypothesis of saving: aggregate implications and tests, “ American Economic Review, 53(1), 55–84. }  Then $C_t=\Omega_t(\sum_{\tau}Y_{\tau}+W)$, with $\Omega_t$ plausibly being in the range 0.05 to 0.09 after Case, Quigley and Shiller. This amount is allocated to the purchase of housing services and the composite good x in each period. 

Individuals maximize utility  subject to spending  no more than C:
\[\displaystyle\max_{h,x}h^{\alpha}x^{\beta}\quad\quad \textrm{s.t.} \quad P_h+x \leq \Omega(\sum_{\tau}Y_{\tau}+W)\]

To keep the analysis simple we will assume that  housing is bought just once at the beginning of the analysis period. We will also assume that income is not affected by changing housing value.  .  
\[W= W_0 -P_0h+\delta_TP^e_Th-\kappa \]

$\delta_TP_Th-P_0$ is the expected gross increase in house value and $\kappa$ is the associated costs of housing transactions. 

The current price, $P_0$,  is established in the market at the time of purchase by bargaining between buyer and seller over the expected net gain, $\delta_TP^e_Th -P_0h-\kappa$. Policies or events that affect $\kappa$ or  $P^e_T$ will affect the path of prices.  

\section{Household behaviour}
We can use a Cobb-Douglas instantaneous utility function $ u(h_t,x_t\ )=h_t^{\alpha}  x_t^{\beta}$. This function yields a constant share lifecycle wealth going to housing. 

Lifetime utility is	\[\Sigma_{\tau=0}^T \delta_u(h_{tau},x_{tau}) \]


The first order condition for this problem is 
\[ \nabla u= \lambda \nabla \big[ ph+x - C \big] \]
The effect of expected housing appreciation then enters only through its contribution to the wealth term in C.
\[ \nabla u= \lambda \nabla \big[ ph+x -\Omega_t\big(\sum_{\tau}Y_t+W_0 -m P_0h-\delta_TP_Th + \kappa\big) \big] \]
so 
\begin{eqnarray*}
\frac{\alpha}{h} u&=& \lambda \big[p-\Omega(-mP_0-\delta_TP_T)\big]\\
 \frac{\beta}{x} u&=&\lambda\\
\end{eqnarray*}
Dividing,
\[\frac{\alpha x}{\beta h} =P_0+\Omega(0.8P_0-P_T)\]
so
\[h=\frac{\alpha x}{\beta (p+\Omega(0.8P_0-P_T)} \]
\begin{eqnarray*}
h^d &=&\frac{\alpha}{\alpha+\beta} u\\
x^d &=&\frac{\beta}{\alpha+\beta} U\\
\end{eqnarray*}
