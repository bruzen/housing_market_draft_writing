%Most of the economic theory talks about where people go, and it doesn't talk about the value they create in the city and where that goes. That's finacialization, capturing those benefits is what capitalists are doing now.

What does this mean - given the particular structure of urban wealth creation.

Who claims those benefits, and what does that mean for productivity and the future of cities?

Our analysis suggests  it actually has  implications for the success of cities. % and of socieities, the future of a middle class, and whether citiec can continue to generate value. 


Cities are essential - draw on bettencourt/west's case,
Geoffrey West has argued that ``Cities are the crucible of civilization, the hubs of innovation, the engines of wealth creation and centers of power, the magnets that attract creative individuals, and the stimulant for ideas, growth, and innovation.'' \cite{westScaleUniversalLaws2017} 
Jane Jacobs talks about the vibrancy of cities, and their central role as the source of productivity. 
 \cite{jacobsEconomyCities1969}.
 
 Cities are particularly central to productivity.
 The scaling of wealth in cities has strong theoretical and empirical support  \cite{bettencourtGrowthInnovationScaling2007, bettencourtOriginsScalingCities2013, dongUnderstandingMesoscopicScaling2020, loboUrbanScalingProduction2013} 


in particular they are key to productivity. Wealth scales superlinearly with density - every increase in productivity, more than increases the productivity of the place. 
The relationship goes back into prehistory, not tied to any approach to government or anything else, from smallest nomadic communities, to largest empires, city states, and modern metropolises.

they live forever - so unlike individuals, don't move, don't die, in the same location as in ancient cities. Tokyo grow back. 


part of the story is what benefits they create
the second is who gets it

Most of the economic theory talks about where people go, and it doesn't talk about the value they create in the city and where that goes. That's finacialization, capturing those benefits is what capitalists are doing now.

The second sub-model incorporates  productivity of cities.

\subsection{What we need to do}
% That sounds more simple than it is because to 
to achieve that, we need actually to 

1. build a model housing market for a city. 

2. And we have to, therefore have an urban model. 

3. And we have to figure out what it is that's at stake in the financialization which turns out to be land rents. And that means the city has to bring together essentially classical land rent theory, modern urban theory and the economics and bidding processes in a housing market. THIS IS THE MAIN PIECE, DO WE  NEED ALL IN THIS LIST?

4. And then it has to keep track of some macro variables that are significant for policy.

\section{The financialization of housing markets}
% This thesis is thus a contribution to developing a modern urban theory of rent.

%The effects of financialization on cities and economies has not been fully accounted for because the tools of the different, relevant disciplines have not been adequately integrated. The current approaches to describing the financialization of housing and its effects predict / explain /account for the housing crisis and effects on home ownership and access to housing, but our work shows that there are broader effects that have not been accounted for / predicted. 
% This fuller picture is made possible by bringing together classical rent theory, neo-classical XX and urban theory to create/and using/along with a agent-based model that allows us to .... (What the modelling technique enables) 
%This work is important for understanding the current policy context. 

\section{Position in the literature}

% We further link the model of urban rents to emerging concerns about the financialization of the housing market. 

%*** (another sentence on why this is great) --The space-less quality of the study of finance leaves out xyz GET PHRASING- CAN'T SEE- INTEGRATION OF SPACE NEGLECT GROWTH FACTOR. 
% Integrating classical and neoclassical economic approaches with standard urban theory,  allows us to identify 
% ..we can build a more comprehensive model of financialization and its effects. This makes it possible to trace the spatial distribution of the rents.

% Rent is important is all these traditions, but has been neglected in modern theory. We argue that to formally understand the processes behind financialization and the housing crisis, what's needed is a modern theory of urban rent. This thesis is a contribution to the development of that theory. REDUNDANCY?

This thesis show that certain things become clear when they are brought together that provide an better account of the current situation. Older economics models do not predict certain things that are currently happening. This is because they are based on out of date modes of production, fail to account for the importance of location value and the modelling tools available when they were developed required some simplification.   Updating the models for the changing times, using more complex modelling systems and incorporating space with the economic models allow us to create models and narratives that provide a more effective understanding of the situation as it stands today.

\section{Modelling the financialization of an urban housing market}

%To capture urban productivity, 
% We introduce %rely on agglomeration effects, relating existing spatial and growth models to the scaling models from the study of complexity. 

% Productivity scales with density in cities, throughout history, this is a strikingly consistent result, stretching even into prehistory. And cities don't die, they are notoriously hard to move.
 %Geoffrey West has argued that ``Cities are the crucible of civilization, the hubs of innovation, the engines of wealth creation and centers of power, the magnets that attract creative individuals, and the stimulant for ideas, growth, and innovation.'' \cite{westScaleUniversalLaws2017} CHECK SOURCE. This urban aglomeration effect, scaling with density of networks and urban vibrancy, is % of course
 
 % MOVE THIS TO SPACE?
%Missing- transfer of money vs put in a spatial framework.
%Most of the economic theory talks about where people go, and it doesn't talk about the value they create in the city and where that goes. That's finacialization, capturing those benefits is what capitalists are doing now.
% rent is being in the house/what they pay, the transfer of money, vs what cities are, and how that produces value..

% Canada faces a housing crisis. The crisis now reaches far into the middle class, causing everything from declining home ownership rates to increasing poverty and displacement. 
%In the last few years, the need for affordable housing has come into focus as one of the most pressing issues facing Canadians. % ***E (ADD STRIKING STATISTIC - A NUMBER OR QUOTATION HERE.) 
% As more and more Canadians are finding

% There has been less work on the implications for productivity. 
% In this thesis we focus on the financialization of housing ownership and its impact on urban productivity in an economy driven by urban agglomeration effects. 

% The source of the rents captured and the broader social and economic effects have not been fully captured. 
 % This provides insight into both population and wealth distribution in cities. 
% Integrating financial markets into the the spatial urban model allows us to examine the effect of financialization on cities, specificaly on their role in growth, distribution, and productivity. % the growth and wealth distribution of cities, and more specifically on their productivity effects.

 % ***E ADD: the effects of housing affordability are pervasive / complex /run through the whole system / go far behind the obvious /direct effects / extend in non-obvious ways through the economy/whole system. What is at stake at a broader level is.

% We see urbanization and continuing and financialization accelerating. Financialization is driven by capital seeking profits, but what is the source of the rents they capture? The answer is in conventional urban theory, which allows us to identify the spatial distribution of those rents and traditional rent theory, which allows us to understand the social relations of those, those rents, the classical economists spend a great deal of time on that question. And we're very clear about it.
%We're talking about what is the puzzle? This is the teaser for this thesis and this thesis offers an answer to and I've just started to suggest that the teaser is given that

XXXZ The current models for understanding financialization and it's effects don't predict the actual trends we are see. {\color{red} We argue this is because they miss the importance of space FIX.} 

%COMPELLING DESCRIPTION OF WHAT'S MISSING IN THE LITERATURE
%these share space, formalization in finance is spaceless



% Alternative phrasing 
%We integrate a labour market into a spatial urban model, set up to explore rent, and implications for the distribution of wealth.



 %calculate the urban surplus, and consider who gets it. 
 
% MOVE TO LIT REVIEW/CONTRIBUTION?
%: The work draws on the Alfonso/Von Thünen model of the concentric city and Dawn Parker and Filatova's work in agent-based modelling of housing markets (see http://jasss.soc.surrey.ac.uk/12/1/3.html 2009).% We begin with a simple model of a circular city with urban agglomeration effects. In subsequent sections we will use an agent-based model to relax assumptions to look at how the interaction between the production of social wealth in cities interacts with housing and the extraction of rent to drive patterns for individuals over space and time.
% Most of the analysis of urban systems has employed analytical models with roots that go back to von Thunen \cite{vonThunen} and more recently Alonzo \cite{ALONZO}. These models are extremely useful, but necessarily abstract from the concrete  and variable individual behaviour and  the details  of dynamics that make real cities path-dependent. XXX \cite{GET-Dawn} have shown that agent-based models can reproduce the features of the analytical models, at least in simple cases. TODO maybe divide chapter on theoretical core, followed by chapter on implementation (general for basic and resilience experiments).

\section{Contributions}

% STORY? We began with what seemed like an obvious statement, and looked for a model to do it, found the modelling tradition was blind to precisely the questions we were trying to explore, surprized, explain why?
% MOVE? The challenge is to develop a simple conceptually clear model that can be extended and used in a wide range so that the tools for thinking about ownership can be integrated and used in analysis of a wide range of ideas using conventional economic theory.
% \begin{enumerate}
%     \item we incorporate \gls{classical rent theory} into an agent-based urban model 
%     \item we allow the creation and distribution of rents to influence urban growth, productivity and  population structure. 
%     \item we incorporate current research on \gls{urban scaling} into the  core spatial urban model.   
%     \item we construct an   Urban \gls{ABM} that is consistent with \gls{neoclassical growth theory},
%     \item we integrate \gls{financial capital} into a standard spatial model of the urban system
%     \item we integrate financial capital into an population model of the urban system
%     \item we employ the ABM to examine how financial markets impact the urban land markets 
%     \item we test for \gls{hysteresis}  resulting from the business cycle  in the urban system 
%     \item we build a model that is easily extended to explore a wide range of issues
%     \item we provide a model that we believe can be used  to evaluate urban policies

\section{Document overview}

%  Finally Part~\ref{part-system} puts the analysis %model %and theory 
% in the context of a larger system, using methods of systems analysis and design, to discusses potential interventions and policy implications.
% \begin{enumerate}
%     \item Chapter~\ref{chapter-interventions} considers the system, examines the potential for a range of interventions, and identifies policy implications. % with a diagram relating interventions.
%     \item TODO chapters .. may analyze particular interventions/cases in more detail: e.g. shared ownership models e.g. acquisition/land trusts, developer models, tax/zoning, and funds/financing.
% \end{enumerate}

% After we develop the mathematical description of the relationship among these will discuss in more detail, various relevant applications, and issues in the literature that draw on parts of this model and apply to the specific situation we're in why rent theory is related to discussions of exploitation why it might lead the inefficiencies, whether or not this links with other important models in the literature.

% Because we draw on a wide range of methods and literatures, we discuss the relevant literature and  methodologies in the chapters where they apply 


\chapter{COMBINE WITH RENT Background} \label{chapter-background}

% There are two dominant stories of \gls{distribution} in economics. The first and oldest is based on the classical concept of rent as explained  by David Ricardo \cite{ricardoEssayInfluenceLow1815}, in which owners of an asset are able to extract a value beyond what they contribute based on their ownership of a scarce resource. 
% The second is the marginalist approach, developed by Clark and others, in which workers and other factors  in competitive markets receive the \gls{marginal value-product} of their contribution to production. 

% Both developed in response to the specific social and economic conditions of the periods in which they emerged. Both attempt to explain where the output of society ended up within society. they are, at their heart, stories of who  claims what share of production.  Classical rent theory  emphasized the distribution of the social surplus, the part of production  over and above what was needed to reproduce society. This included only land rents initially, but was extended to the distribution of profit profits.   These are exactly the types of surplus income that are not explained by the neoclassical theory, which is  awkward because profits and rents form a substantial part of national income (20--25 percent) in the world the neoclassical model describes. In this thesis we identify classical rents intn the urban systems and exxamine their distribution.. 
% % ***E FIRSTNAME Ricardo was a INSERT NATIONALITY classical economist  in the WHICH Century. 

%Classical economics emerged in the 16$^{th}$ and 17$^{th}$ centuries at a time of exploding colonial wealth. In this period,  European economies were still structured largely around agricultural production in which farmers OR peasants work the land  owned by the descendants of feudal aristocrats. Urban economies based around factories were just beginning to emerge as significant drivers of wealth.\footnote{The Industrial Revolution is usually described as beginning around 1760 and having significantly transformed society by about 1820--1840.} % It was only after 1650 that living standards in the UK did start to increase for a sustained period. Before the modern era of economic growth, the economy worked very differently. Not technological progress, but the size of the population determined the standards of living.} 
In this economic context, the agricultural surplus is captured by feudal aristocrats. 

%As WHAT LED TO THE EXPLOSION... CHANGES IN UNIVERSITIES OR THE ECONOMY, there was an explosion of thinking about social and economic structures and systems.  This was a period where a range of thinkers explored many ideas to explain the shifting social and economic conditions. 

%Distribution, or who got what share of production was a central concern. This focus came to the forefront in the 1600s and 1700s as colonial expansion of land holdings, factories and supplied change concentrated wealth---funding investment in the arts and sciences, great fortunes---harsher conditions for farmers, pushed of their land with enclosures, and concentrated in urban factories, almost exclusively poor with---illness bad working conditions % 90 rural, population snap shot % (unprecedented in northern Europe, a relative backwater)---%gt (new ineuqlity---jusxtabosition---fortuioned unpreciendet ont hat content to rivla hsotori great- wons- woth workers dying, kids in factories- Dickens period, pesantry..---both were new- the eilsure)

% The new form is the urban
% dense exchange - experience in person density can compete with screen experience -

%In this context, Ricardo refined the classical concept of rent.  

% ***E Today the word rent is usually used to refer to payments made by a tenant to a landlord to for the right to occupy a property, but this is not the traditional economic concept of  rent.  

% ***E As a concept, it's more closely related to profit / surplus than to rent paid for properties. 


% ***E NEED TO ADD HOW DOES THIS CONTRIBUTE OR EQUATE TO A THEORY OF DISTRIBUTION... WHAT DOES IT EXPLAIN...
%Ricardo's concept of rent accounted for the way that.... WHAT IT DESCRIBED. 
%This remains important to understanding distribution in general because.....


%The marginalist account describes how workers receive the marginal value of their contribution to production. THIS MEANS.....
%It formalizes what classical economist Adam Smith describes in the story of the pin factory. (EXPLAIN PIN FACTORY)

%The marginalist account of distribution gave a story of production that seemed to align with the rising fortunes of workers following WWII, in the 1950s and 1960s when it came to dominate. 

%This narrative dominates in neo-classical economics, particularly in the United States, and formed the basis of conventional micro-economics training. (EVEN NOW OR WHEN)
%It was also influential in shaping public discourse and policy in the early 20th century. For example, because it implies WHAT THAT MEANS MONOPOLY IS BAD... it provided the intellectual foundation for anti-monopoly political movements in the early 20th century.

\textbf{These two stories each reflect a distinct dominant mode of production}, period in society, and methodological set of tools available.From the Classical to Neo-Classical economic approaches, we also see development in the methodological approaches to describing economies. In Ricardo's era, economics was characterized by a free flowing descriptive approach characterized by wide debate, and many concepts explored. By the the time the marginalist approach emerged, new mathematical approaches were beginning to emerge OR dominate the economic discourse.

of distribution by developing a theory of modern urban rent which integrates the classical descriptive work on rent and the neoclassical marginalist approach, with modern work on the scaling of wealth in cities. 

Just as the classical and neo-classical approaches \textbf{responded to and theorized the dominant mode of production in their time,} the theoretical framework emerging now, responds to the economic and social factors that are defining this period.  The early stories of production from thinkers like Ricardo centred on exploring who claimed the surplus from agricultural production Over time, the story moved to industrial production.

\section{OLD Implementation}


Household agents have:
\begin{enumerate}
   \item A home. Agents live somewhere, inside or outside the city,
   \item finances: they have assets, a housing budget, income, and a spending pattern - family lending pattern  
   shaped by profession, demographics, family structure, etc.) - risk profile
   \item utility function: they have a utility function with location  preferences - amenity, open space, house size requirements, transportation costs - shaped by profession, demographics, family structure, etc
\end{enumerate}	

Buyers then consult with a financial agent to determine the maximum mortgage and interest rate they'd qualify for based on their income. This gives an upper bound to the range of homes they may consider. 

Finally agents valuate the homes offered and place bids. % For simplicity of implementation, they place bids on all homes they consider.

\subsection{Initial conditions}
Initialize the model with grid. Each element contains 1 housing unit.

The model space is divided into a uniform grid of single family homes % Additions: apartment buildings, a mechanism to subdivide homes, rent bedrooms, accumulate adjacent land and build new higher density buildings, an urban land boundary, a mechanism for wealth agglomeration through density.

The social structure of the model begins with urban workers who commute and earn wages in the urban commuter-shed, and rural residents and landowners who may choose to move to the city. 
We imagine the initial set of workers in our city commuting daily, being paid monthly and residing in urban housing for their working lives, which are arbitrarily set. 

Initially all urban workers are also homeowners. When we allow the initial urban residents to retire, they may sell or rent out their properties to new workers. This introduces an additional \gls{class} of resident, the urban tenant. The final agent in the model is a `bank' that represents both the financial sector and the owners of financial capital. The bank provides mortgage funds can %may actively 
purchase land as a financial asset on behalf of investors.

\subsection{Model Steps - Housing market}
% Figure xyz traces the flow. 
In each time step agents firms update wages and job availability, agents decide whether to work and whether to buy and sell homes.
 % Schedule: Multi step by breed
 % Steps Labour
 % step - workers: market/production, enter market to buy, list properties real estate agent matches agents - has bids 
 % bidding - workers and firm consider properties and make bids (2nd step or spread over 2 steps)
 % negotiation - sellers consider and accept bids (or real estate agents manage negotiation)
%Buyers evaluate their need for housing.
% Agents decide whether to enter the housing market as a renter or a buyer.

at every time step 
    1) Some new tenants arrive into the city
    
    2) All unhoused tenants look for a housing unit 
    
        a) They have to decide whether to buy or rent. Decision depends on their income, and the availability of Corporation of Public Housing loans 


        b) If they buy, they seek apartment and evaluate, and place a bid (see ALMA)
        
        c) if they rent, they look for an apartment that matches xyz criteria, and place request to rent. Rental is given by the landlord to the first tenant that matches the asking rental price. 


Workers give up their search and leave the city if they do not find a housing unit 

%\input{notes_and_references/z Background rough notes - rent history etc.tex}


\subsection{***Initialization}

% We explore the wealth forming dynamics of the urban agglomeration effect by modelling % a city in which 
Agents work in the city and leave their jobs when they reach retirement age.
New agents enter the city to work.

% There is an outside world in two respects. NEAT 
 
 If there is a housing market, agents can move. %In the analytic case above, the population stays in place, and travels to work if it is worthwhile given the transportation costs. 
%Those who come to the city will be those for whom the benefits the city offers make it worthwhile to  whether that's building their network, accessing markets, accessing amenity, learning, finding specialized employment, or increased wages. In this model 
The demand for labour drives urban growth. % The housing market depends on how many people from the periphery are completing to claim places in the city. TODO IF ANY RURAL AGENT COULD MOVE IF THE CITY HAS ADDITIONAL DEMAND FOR LABOUR, HOW DO WE DECIDE WHICH DO? Could use a parameter for immigration (or how 'hot' the market is) and in the simplest case (corresponding to how many agents from outside are looking at the housing/rental market), have the inflow match. % Agents have debt and there is an undifferentiated labour market


Workers can leave the workforce and retire, and new people can come into the city. 

Initially, all homes are owner-occupied. This is of interest as a starting point because we are interested in the evolution of a society with widespread home ownership in the face of financialization pressures. 

We also start with owners who have a long run before retirement. The housing market is  during the initialisation runs to allow the wage and population to converge. The all-ownership, no-turnover case provides a basis for expectation-formation and examining the basic population-productivity dynamic. 

When agents reach the end of their set working lives they retire. %It is easy to introduce random life events, differentiated households and other variety, but while this kind of variation is likely to generate  complex and interesting life stories it is not what we choose to focus on at this stage.  
Owners may sell their homes and either leave the city or move to cheaper housing. the latter would put pressure on housing supply. New entrants to the labour force come from outside of the city at various stages in their life cycle and either buy or rent homes. 

\section{ANALYSIS - MOVE}
\epigraph{“An economist is someone who says, when an idea works in practice, ‘let’s see if it works in theory.'”
Walter W. Heller, former chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers.}{ Walter W. Heller, former chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers. (\href{https://quoteinvestigator.com/2015/08/30/practice/}{1979, The Washington Star)}}


The model shows how land rent is captured by landowners and how that affects wealth creation and the development of the city. 
Rents go to landowners. %the owners of a given property. 
Landowners therefore capture a fraction of the wage premium generated by agglomeration.
If workers own their own homes, rents go to them. If others own the land, they capture them.

Land value rises as the city grows, so newcomers pay more for housing near the centre.

% Agglomeration benefits get extracted by landowners. Labour gets only their marginal value they don't get any of the surplus. They don't even keep always their marginal value.
The dynamic story is that the class of landowners eventually becomes financial capital.
PLOT RENTS HERE
The value of land increases over time. Those who purchase land earlier claim a share of the growing value of the city. % As the city grows, they own an increasingly valuable asset.
 
%In this model, workers are the initial owners, but they build this wealth which becomes a source of capital that can support them.
EQUATION FOR THE SHARE THEY CAN CAPTURE

In the case in which individual workers purchase houses and then sell them on retirement, the housing market drives the creation of classes on its own. A strictly random process in which agents have a range of ages and sell at retirement creates a structural advantage where workers who arrive earlier in the city and own land, benefit from their own labour but also get to claim a share of the productive output of the city as it grows. % those who begin work later. % to a division in wealth
%the emergence of a class of those who came early and those who came late.
%Early agents may also rent out their land. Could it be though of as a pyramid scheme?

%With financialization, in the case where 
If financialized buyers can access a better interest rate, they can consolidate ownership, capture rents, drive class differentials, and amplify wealth inequality. % This appears to be the case as lenders offer wealthier and larger entities lower interest rates. % We expect to observe in this class of models larger, likely power law-distributed, wealth effects.

%There is a supply of money- if there's too much for other investments, some will flow here- e.g. excess liquidity.

\subsection{Implications}
- totaly tax maintained
Germany higher natural redistribution..

This fits empirical results of increasing financialzaiton 70+ financialized
Fr\'ed\'erick Demers found that the response of housing investment to interest rates has become more pronounced over time \cite{demersModellingForecastingHousing2005}. %Modelling and Forecasting Housing Investment: The Case of Canada,  Research Department, Bank of Canada, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada K1A 0G9 fdemers@bankofcanada.ca



Friedman’s 1953 essay, ``The Case for Flexible Exchange Rates'' \cite{friedmanEssaysPositiveEconomics1953} argued that speculation is stabilizing. Market prices in this view  are set on the basis of economic fundamentals- what we call the warranted price. When prices diverge from those fundamentals that creates a profitable opportunity. Speculators then step in and buy or sell, driving prices back to the level warranted by fundamentals.

Increasing the number of traders and volume of trading is also regarded as improving financial market outcomes. Increased trade volume increases market liquidity 



\section{Intro conclusions/summary}
The model has a Solow-Swan style production model with agglomeration effects using a \gls{Cobb-Douglas} production function that incorporates Jacobs-style labour-augmenting agglomeration economies %(Beaudry and Schiauerova 2009, Panne 2004, J. Jacobs 1969), 
in the way neoclassical growth theory incorporates labour-augmenting technical change.
It integrates the production function with an Alonso-style urban model of a city economy \cite{alonzoTheoryUrbanLand1960}.

\chapter{MODEL PARTS CUT FROM BACKGROUND CHAPTERS}

\section{GROWTH}

\section{Equilibrium city size and the scale factor} 
At this point, we can briefly describe how the discussion of this chapter relates to our overall modeling. There are four basic equations in the model. The first two link output and the wage to population. the third links the wage to the extent of the city and the last  provides the population of the city

Equation one, following Bettencourt (p65) says that  urban productivity is proportional to population via a scale factor:\footnote{ In contemporary US cities productivity increases by about 11\% with each doubling of their population.  Urban Scaling and the Production Function for Cities Lobo J, Bettencourt LMA, Strumsky D, West GB (2013) PLOS ONE 8(3): e58407. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0058407 }, 
\[Y= GN^{\beta}\]  

and has both theoretical and empirical support. 


\cite{arvidssonUrbanScalingLaws2023} find that cities’ tails are responsible for 36--80\% of the observed superlinearities across indicators. 

% \begin{tabular}{ll}
% $Y$ is &Aggregate urban output, or GDP \\
% %$\alpha$ & agricultural wage\\
% $G$ is&a `prefactor,' possibly time dependent, an initial population\\
%  $N$ is& city population\\
% $ \beta$  is& scale factor, the elasticity of output with respect to city population .\\
% \end{tabular}\vspace{.5cm}

This is illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig-scale-output} for $\beta=1.25$ and $G=1$. The significant features are the upward-bending total output curve that indicates increasing productivity per capita for the city and the rising marginal product of labour.

\begin{figure}[htb]

    \end{center}
\end{figure}

The right hand side of second equation is derived from the first bvy differentiation and combined with a result from the theory of the firm that says that the firm should hire until the marginal value product of labour is equal to the total wage, $\omega+w$, where $w$ is the `subsistance wage' that is earned by non-urban workers.  
\[\omega+w = \beta GN^{\beta-1}\]

The third is the population equilibrium condition, that requires that at the boundary of the city, $d^*$,  transportation costs, $td^*$, consume the entire wage:
 \[d^*=\frac{\omega}{t}\]

 The fourth is the function that generates the total urban poulation. In the standard circular city, for example, with a uniform density, $\delta$,  
 \[N=\delta\pi (d^*)^2\]
 % \[N=\delta\pi (\frac{\omega}{t})^2\]
 %\[N=\delta\pi (\frac{\beta GN^{\beta-1}-w}{t})^2\]
 
 The equilibrium population  is: 
% \[N=\delta\pi (\frac{\beta GN^{\beta-1}-w}{t})^2\]

\begin{eqnarray}
    N&=&\delta\pi (\frac{\beta GN^{\beta-1}-w}{t})^2\\
    &=&\frac{\delta\pi }{t^2} \left[\beta GN^{2\beta-2} -w^2\right]
\end{eqnarray}

This expression can be treated as a difference equation if we consider the left hand side as $M_{c}$ and the right hand side  function of the previous period's as population, $N_{{c}-1}$.



\subsection{Incorporating agglomeration economies in production} \label{section-agglomeration-production}
%Production economies generated by agglomeration enter the production functions of the firms and, indirectly,  the aggregate production function of the city. 
A simple way  to introduce an agglomeration effect on the production side that is consistent with the existing literature is  to use a \gls{Solow-Swan model} with labour augmenting technical change (\cite{solowContributionTheoryEconomic1956, swanEconomicGrowthCapital1956}), $Y(t)=K(t)^{\alpha }(A(t)n)^{\beta }$ where $t$ denotes time,  %$0<\alpha<1$ is the elasticity of output with respect to capital, $\beta$ the elasticity of output with respect to effective labour,
 and $Y (t )$  represents total production. 
We %remove time  $t$ except in the technical change term, where we replace it with the population value $n$. To avoid confusion with the consumption amenity, we
 replace $A(t)$ %in the Solow-Swan models
  with $A(n)$, representing a labour-augmenting agglomeration effect.\footnote{The Mankiw--Romer--Weil version of the model adds a term for human capital.  It is not clear it would make a qualitative difference for our analysis.}  This differs from  the Slow-Swan, model in which labour augmenting technical change increases according to an exogenous (exponential) law.\footnote{An attractive ways to specify $A(n)$  is to use a simple exponential, $A(n)=n^\phi$, which changes Equation~\ref{eqn-solow-swan2} 
  We %The model  can produce increasing returns in the aggregate, which can drive city growth.
\begin{eqnarray}
 Y&=K^{\alpha }(n^{\phi }n)^{\beta}  \nonumber\\
 Y&=K^{\alpha }n^{\beta(1 +\phi)}
\label{eqn-solow-swan1}
\end{eqnarray}
This makes it clear that we can have increasing returns to scale for the urban economy if  $\alpha + \beta(1+ \phi)>1$ even with a production function at the firm level that is decreasing returns to scale ($\alpha +\beta<1$)).\label{footnote-psi}}  
%Rising transportation costs may become the limit on firm or city expansion.  
  
  $A(n)n$ is  ``effective labour'' and 
%\footnote{The Mankiw-Romer-Weil version of model adds a term for human capital.  It is not clear it would make a qualitative difference for our analysis.}  $T$ refers to effect of \textbf{labour-augmenting agglomeration}. The model then says that the 
firm output is 
\begin{equation} 
Y=K_i^{\alpha }(A(n)n_i)^{\beta }
\label{eqn-solow-swan2}
\end{equation}
% If $\beta=1-\alpha$, this is a constant returns to scale (CRS) production function. Without agglomeration effects, $T(n)=1$,  Then 
% \textbf{$\mathbf{L(n) = T(n) n}$ 
An individual firm will purchase labour time  and sell the product of effective labour. 
?If labour markets are competitive, it will set $\die{Y}{L}=w$.
We can assume  that $A(1)=1$ and $\frac{\partial A}{\partial n}>0$. 

Notice that this model ascribes all agglomeration effects to labour rather than capital. Deepening  and widening of the labour pool was one of Marshall's explanations of the formation of industrial districts. The model can therefor  be seen as incorporating a Jacobs/Marshall externality (\cite{beaudryWhoRightMarshall2009, vanderpanneAgglomerationExternalitiesMarshall2004}) of the sort often invoked as an explanation of industrial clusters. These externalities  are not a product of any firm or individual. 









\subsection{Labour demand} \label{section-labour-demand}
%This equation shows labour supply increasing with the square of the wage.  
%The  inverse labour supply function  is
%	\begin{equation}
%	w= (\frac{ {c}^2s}{\pi})^{0.5} L^{0.5},	%\label{eqn-inverse-labour-supply}
%	\end{equation}
%which is clearly increasing with the square root of the wage. 
%It's easier to show the wage curve is declining at a faster rate withthis equation. 

%K The marginal product of labour is declining. While adding more labour may always adds some value, the rate drops off.  If the marginal product increased, then a firm that got large enough would out compete smaller firms, hire all labour, always be able to produce more wealth by hiring more people, and would always produce more wealth by hiring people than by firing people. This doesn't happen.

%K Perhaps, the firm hires employees who best fit its needs first, but to grow, eventually it must hire less selectively. Finding markets may get harder with growth. Perhaps expansion adds additional costs, building a parking lot, administration, acquiring    a larger building. Whatever the explanation, the marginal product of labour declines. 

Profit maximizing firms  set the marginal value product of labour, $p\frac{\partial Y_i}{\partial n_i}$, equal to the wage. The marginal product of labour, however,  is complicated by the presence of the  agglomeration effect, $A(\sum n_j)$:
\begin{eqnarray} \frac{\partial Y_i}{\partial n_i} &=   K_i^\alpha \left(  \beta A n_i^{\beta-1}  + n_i^{\beta}A'  \right)  \nonumber\\
&=   \beta\frac{1}{n_i} Y_i   +  Y_i \frac{A'}{A}  \nonumber  \\
&=   Y_i  \left[  \beta\frac{1}{n_i}  + \frac{A' }{A} \right] \label{eqn-mpl}
\end{eqnarray}
The first term in the square bracket in Equation~\ref{eqn-mpl} might be termed the \textbf{private myopic marginal product}. It is the addition to output directly attributable to an additional worker. This myopic MPL is smaller than the actual marginal product for the firm.  
The second term in the bracket   is the marginal agglomeration effect. It captures the effect on firm-wide labour productivity---an increase in effective labour---that results from adding a worker. We can expect this to be very small.\footnote{Using the specification in Footnote~\ref{footnote-psi}, $Lambda(n)=n^\psi$, it would be $\frac{\psi}{n}$. If f $\psi=0.1$ and $n=250,000$ the number is $\frac{A' }{A} =4\times 10^{-7}$.}% REVIEW THIS 
% REVIEW THIS TOO
%\footnote{Firm size matters. 
%A monopoly employer would take into account the marginal agglomeration effect. 
%A firm that employed a large enough fraction of the urban workforce to notice agglomeration effects, say $\frac{1}{n}<k<1$, would enjoy that fraction of the external effect and set the wage at  
%\[w_k =  \beta\left( \frac{1}{n}+ \frac{kA'}{A(n)} \right)	Y\].} 


It seems likely that the agglomeration effect of adding a worker on the productivity of other workers in that firm, $Y_i \frac{A'}{A}$, would be difficult to attribute to a new worker. It would be a lagged, unevenly distributed effect, and would appear exogenous, and so would not be compensated. We assume therefore that firms do not take the second term into account. %If we also assume that firms take the wage as parametric, firms hire until the private myopic marginal product falls to the observed wage, 
%		\[  \beta\frac{1}{n_i} Y_i =    w+\phi , \]
implying firms will hire fewer than the optimal number of workers.

\end{table}%


Even taking into account firm-wide labour productivity gains, the private marginal product of labour is likely to be computed on the assumption that other firms do not expand  their workforce. This could be call the `zero conjectural variation' (0CV) case. 
If all firms  were expected to respond to the same signal the same way (1CV), the agglomeration effect  would be multiplied by the number of firms, $\frac{n }{n_i}$. The marginal agglomeration effect for firm $i$ is then $\frac{n }{n_i}\frac{A' }{A}Y_i =\frac{A' }{A}Y$. 

Since the increase in $A$ affects all firms, the  social marginal product of all firms expanding their workforce by one worker as $i$ does must be multiplied again by the number of firms. The  value of the agglomeration effect increases with the number of firms.

 Figure~\ref{fig-growth-amenity.tex} illustrates the labour supply curve and the four versions of MPL that arise for any standard production function with diminishing marginal product of labour and agglomeration effects of the sort we model. These agglomeration effects account for O'Sullivans axioms (b), (c) and (d) for this and similar models. 

 
\subsubsection{Output and wage}
We need a combination of classical and neoclassical distribution theory.

City output is divided among the classes of society. Neoclassical theory suggests wages are allocated according to marginal product and classical theory suggests rents according to the pattern of ownership.

Equation one, in effect determines a wage, (Given the observed values for the scaling coefficients for total wages and labour, $bW < 1.15$ and $bL < 1$, )  although there are many possible distributional specifications and many possible labour market and firm structures. Bettencourt provides two  estimates,  1.11 and 1.35, for the scale factor for urban personal income in the Brazil and South Africa respectively. A more recent  study supports the Bettancourt results for China.\footnote{Wu W, Zhao H, Tan Q, Gao P. An Urban Scaling Estimation Method in a Heterogeneity Variance Perspective. Entropy (Basel). 2019 Mar 28;21(4):337. doi: 10.3390/e21040337. PMID: 33267051; PMCID: PMC7514821.} 

\subsubsection{Wage and city size}
The third determines the extent of the city. This comes form the Alonzo model discussed in chapter XXXXA.

\end{figure}

A simple case is the circular city with uniform transportation cost, $t$. \[r^*= \frac{w}{t}\]% A more complex model might have density depend on location, for example, in the continous circular cityt\,
If transportation costs vary by  distance we might have something like this constraint on extent\[w=\int_0^{d*} t(d)dt.\]

This approach imposes an equilibrium condition on the model. It is unnecessary working with a citation of known extent and density. The analytic approach is easily extended to variable transportation cost, although at the expense of additional computational complexity.

\subsubsection{City extent and population}
Equation  four  closes the model by linking the extent of the city to the population. A simple case is the circular city with uniform population $d$, where $d$ is density per unit area and $r^*$ is the radius of the city: \[P=d\pi r^{*2}\] 
More generally, density might vary with for example, the distance $r$ from the centre of the city:
\[P=\pi \int_{0}^{r*}d(r)\,dr\] 
In a computational model a table of densities would provide the link.

\subsection{Cities becoming productive}
 The growth of many cities was initially fueled by agricultural rents and resource exports. The industrial revolutions transformed many of these consumption cities into thriving production centers. 

while the ``origins'' of consumption cities can be traced to (i)
resource rents, (ii) rents from agricultural exports in countries with sufficiently high agricultural productivity, and (iii) ``premature'' deindustrialization.  Source:
%\href{https://www.brookings.edu/blog/future-development/2022/07/14/1622441/}
{Are cities engines of production or consumption, and does it matter?}


\section{Model assumptions}
\begin{enumerate}
\item There is full employment, no frictional unemployment, and no labour adjustment costs.
\item Firms set output and factor inputs to maximize profits, so factors are paid the value of their marginal private product
\item Demand for output is perfectly elastic (constant price = 1)
\end{enumerate}


Rural producers pay a wage $\psi$. this covers a standard house, lot, entertainment, diet and consumption pattern. We  choose units so that per-period cost of a unit of productive capital is also $\psi$
