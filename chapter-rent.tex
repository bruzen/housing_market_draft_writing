\chapter{Antecedents of modern Urban Rent theory}
In this chapter, we link classical rent theory, neoclassical production theory, neoclassical growth theory, the scaling literature, and urban spatial models. 

%We use the Cobb-Douglas function %, which is used to cross this entire range of literature to illustrate each link and to show how our model is directly connected with this broad collection of linked theories. 
%The Cobb-Douglas function is a production function, expressing the output produced, in terms of inputs such as labour and capital.
%Our model connects to the results in this chapter at four points:



\section{Classical theories of production and distribution}
INTRODUCE RICARDO, CLASSICAL THEORIES - OR RESTRUCTURE AS AN INTRO SENTENCE.
MAYBE REVIEW SOME ALTERNATIVES/FRAME RICARDO
 % \subsection{Ricardo}

 The core social question that Ricardo addressed was who gets the surplus. % The question was pressing because it appeared that landlords were capturing the surplus without contributing to production while many of those who worked that land were very poor. 
Ricardo uses his model to explain the distribution of the product of the earth among the “three classes of the community” which is to say, to the owners of land, labour, and capital. 

% going back to the Physiocrates. 
% The physiocratic school of economics was the first to see labor as the sole source of value but, for the physiocrats, in the context of the prevalent European rural society of the time, only agricultural labor created a surplus. % actually? % detail for it was ag economy This was the theory? also the french enginneers- detail for start of math/calc-..
%The canonical reference for only agricultural labour mattering? For the definition of rent?

%Ricardo's famous 1815 discussion of capital and  land rent \footnote{ %\href{http://la.utexas.edu/users/hcleaver/368/368RicardoOnCornLaws.html}{An Essay on the Influence of a low Price of Corn on the Profits of Stock}; 
%showing the Inexpediency of Restrictions on Importation: With Remarks on Mr Malthus' Two Last Publications: "An Inquiry into the Nature and Progress of Rent," and "The Grounds of an Opinion on the Policy of restricting the Importation of Foreign Corn"} provides the canonical reference. 
% We haven't introduced this model or what kind of thing it is.
The concept of rent in economics must be distinguish from the common use of the term to mean the payment paid to rent a property. 

In the classical tradition, rent is the value landowners claimed for the use of their land. Ricardo defines rent strictly in this way, saying ``By rent I always mean the remuneration given to the landlord for the use of the original power of the land\footnote{'' David Ricardo corn laws note 7.}. % explan that ricardo used this as a formal definition of the term. he ....

For Ricardo, and for the classical economics in general however, land rent, is a kind of surplus value, that is an amount available after the costs of production have been paid, the term rent came to be used interchangeably with this more general concept in much of the classical work on rent.
%and the term rent has been used in a more general sense to other kinds of surplus value, as well as land rents 
as Saunders says in 1902, ``Of the concrete forms of income that have usually been classed as surplus, the rent of land was the earliest to be defined; and so prominent a position has been given to it that the terms "rent" and "surplus" have come to be used interchangeably.'' \footnote{Rent in Modern Economic Theory: An Essay in Distribution Author(s): Alvin Saunders Johnson, Publications of the American Economic Association, Nov., 1902, 3rd Series, Vol. 3, No. 4 (Nov., 1902), pp. 1-129}. 
So for instance professional sports players' income, above the opportunity cost they could get working at another position, is rent they capture for their skill. 

The classical idea of rent and rent can be illustrated with the story of a carter who picks up vegetables at the farm gate and transports them into town, where he sells them to a  storekeeper. %He pays the farmer at one end of the trip and is paid at the other. 
For simplicity, assume all farmers have the same cost of production, and the carters pay the farmer the farm gate price at the farm and receive the merchant price in town. 

\begin{figure}
    \begin{center}
    \input{fig/rent_ricardo.tex}
    \caption{Transport costs, the yellow area, take a share of the profit for vegetables sold in the town}
    \label{fig:rent_ricardo}
    \end{center}
\end{figure}

In the figure \ref{fig:rent_ricardo}, total transport costs are shown as the yellow area. The area below the yellow triangle is profit for the carter. The carter makes a `profit' on the trip to the farm nearest to town, but there is a farm so far out  that transport costs eat up all the profit on the trip. That is as far as the carter will go\footnote{Note the similarity with Alonzo's urban model, illustrated in Fig \ref{Fig:rent_alonzo}.}. Ricardo termed this point the `extensive margin', the point at which there is no value for farming for the town. It is the limit for this use, and the profit there is zero. If the price goes up, the extensive margin moves out, and more land comes into production.

The land rent declines with distance from the town,\footnote{It also declines for less fertile land, where there is a higher cost of production.} At the extensive margin the land rent falls to zero. Even fertile land beyond the extensive margin will not be farmed because the product cannot be transported to market at a profit.\footnote{This simple example assumes that the land is uniformly productive and that there is only one product that can be marketed. Johann Heinrich von Th\"unen, in The Isolated state (Der isolierte Staat (1826)), provide a more complex analysis based on the same principles.} Transportation costs and the price of produce in town determine the size of the  rent triangle and therefore the amount of rent captured by the land-owning class.\footnote{The debate about the  `Corn Laws" that Ricardo  was engaged in was about whether Britain would allow wheat form Canada and Australia to enter, reducing the price of wheat and therefore reducing the income and influence of the land-owning class.} 

Together these two triangles/areas represent the ``produce of the earth'', but only the lower triangle is net income\footnote{ Termed the `\textit{produit net}' by the Physiocrats}. In modern supply and demand analysis it would be recognized as `producer surplus', the difference between what a producer gets for a good and what they would be willing to accept.

In Ricardo's case: the land owner delivers the grain to market and receives the merchant price. The profit is what the landowner could claim for the privilege of using the land %The profit now accrues to the landowner, and we call it land rent. For Ricardo, it was obvious that the land-owning class captured the land rent.
\footnote{In the modern economy, agricultural land rents may be captured by corporations,  either by owning the land or by controlling the supply chain.}  Landlord income is a locational land rent that exists because of the land's proximity to the market. 
 

%\subsection{A more explicit treatment}

Ricardo expounded a theory of land rent. While he did not write down a formal production function as later neoclassical theorists would, modern neoclassical production theory can be seen as having one of its origins in his work on classical economic theory.
In modern notation, Ricardo's model can be written:

\begin{equation} 
Y=F(K,L,N).
\label{Eqn:Prod1}
\end{equation} 

where $K$ is capital, $L$ is labour and $N$  is the natural resource  land.\footnote{This makes it a three factor model of production (cite us/lit) In principle any number of factors can be included.}  
Ricardo does not specify a functional form, but, %like mathematical neoclassical economists, 
he does assume diminishing returns to all factors. The landlord  receives the surplus generated by the land and the rest of the value of production goes to labour and to any capital employed in improving the land. 

The value of the land is the present discounted value of the surplus it generates, that is what it would be worth paying now, to capture the future rents from that land.


\subsection{Marx}


%Ricardo, agreeing with Malthus, essentially assumes that the wage is  just sufficient to reproduce the labouring class.\footnote{``In the natural advance of society, the wages of labour will have a tendency to fall, as far as they are regulated by supply and demand; for the supply of labourers will continue to increase at the same rate, while the demand for them will increase at a slower rate.''} He then explains the distribution of the fruits of labour on the land among the main classes of the economy.

 Marx shifted attention to the manufacturing economy in which the owners contributed the machinery, buildings, and even working capital to fund the workers until the product can be sold. %This contribution must be accumulated from their profits in the preceding cycle of production,  and has to be reinvested once the revenues of the current round have come in and the bills have been paid. Marx actually describes a circuit of capital from its form as money to its form as physical capital. 
As in Ricardo, however, labour is in surplus and capital is scarce. As in Ricardo the scarce factor owned by a special class - now the capitalists, is able to appropriate the is able to capture the surplus value. %Like Ricardo,  Marx saw the appropriation of surplus as without moral justification. 

Marx pointed to a new dynamic in capitalist systems - that productive capital is not fixed as land is, but  expands as surplus is reinvested. %He famously suggested that the expansion will eventually outrun the expansion of demand and the rate of return will fall, leaving capitalists unwilling to invest. % and creating a crisis. 

Marx gives the statement of the dynamic quality of the surplus
- work linking urban rents to the dynamic quality of the surplus in the urban system is in that tradition 
- how does the generative surplus gets distributed, its dynamics/the dynamics of the surplus. 
 
\subsection{Henry George} 


  Henry George, an influential American political economist,\footnote{Progress and Poverty: An Inquiry into the Cause of Industrial Depressions and of Increase of Want with Increase of Wealth: The Remedy (1879) book by social theorist and economist Henry George.}  returned to land rent with a new insight based on the emergence of the capitalist city: ``With the growth of population, land grows in value, and the men who work it must pay more for the privilege.'' For George the owners of urban land extract surplus in exactly the same way that owners of agricultural land in Ricardo's analysis. Where Marx saw the extravagant productivity of capital as the source of capitalist crises, George saw the extraction of wealth by land speculators as the mechanism that would bring on crises.
  
  Since land rent is not created by its owners, George argued that land rent should be seen as a social income - that it could be used to pay for all the needs of the community. The clearest statement of this view is found in Progress and Poverty: "We must make land common property." The same view was expressed by the Physiocrats who concluded  that ``ground rents'' should be the source of most or all taxes. They defined ground rent as that portion of all rent which is attributable only to the size and location of the parcel. George's analysis the `single tax' movement, which sought to shift all taxation to land  and resource rents.   
  
  In 1977, Joseph Stiglitz  showed, using a standard urban model, identified the conditions in which Henry George's "single tax" is  the only tax necessary to finance public expenditures.\footnote{Arnott, Richard J.; Joseph E. Stiglitz (November 1979). "Aggregate Land Rents, Expenditure on Public Goods, and Optimal City Size" (PDF). Quarterly Journal of Economics. 93 (4): 471–500. doi:10.2307/1884466. JSTOR 1884466. S2CID 53374401 }   The logic is fairly simple: if the public good increases productivity or the attractiveness of a city, attracting more people or businesses, land rents rise, and investment in the public good should proceed until the marginal cost of the public good is equal to the increase in land rent it brings. The result is now called the `Henry George theorem.'



The classical economists agreed that rents are unearned income. They did not emphasize, as George did, that land rents arise from labour's proximity to urban population and production.\footnote{To be fair, it was not lack of understanding, that the omission reveals, but rather lack of interest in explicitly examining urban land rent from residential or even industrial purposes.}% Ricardo von Thunen, Marx, Cantillon all grasped the notion of proximity to the market as part of the source land rent. The discussions seem to not gone farther than discussions of diffeerential and rents, however.  I just am not aware of them explicitly examining urban land rent for residential or even industrial purposes. 

%The need to be near a market or prodduction center is easily seen by considering a population at the carrying capacity of the land with individuals supporting themselves using purely local resources. There can be no land rent in this case. If a city rises that must be supplied from those still on the land, land close enough to the city will generate land rent. The value of the land is created by proximity to the city.



%  no separate and comprehensive data are provided on the amounts of land rents and subsoil rents charged and earned, because they are not officially regarded as part of value-added, and consequently are not included in the calculation of GDP (except for the value of productive lease contracts)     https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_and_absolute_ground_rent#Rent_in_macro-economics    \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_and_absolute_ground_rent#Rent_in_macro-economics}{Wikipediat article on differential rent}

Stiglits is linking the capture of urban rents to productivity.

  \subsection{John Bates Clark and neoclassical distribution theory}
  Classical theories of distribution showed that ownership of a scarce and non-produced factor, land, was the  basis of rent extraction by the class of landowners. Profits were a bit puzzling in this context - Capital also earns its return from scarcity. Marshall pointed out, however, that scarcity profits (i.e., rent) would normally be competed away  as entrepreneurs entered the market in pursuit of those `excess' profits. He used the term `pseudo-rents' for these unearned but temporary incomes.\footnote{Alvin Saunders Johnson. Rent in Modern Economic Theory: An Essay in Distribution. AEA 3rd Series, Vol. 3, No. 4 (Nov., 1902), pp. 1-129 (129 pages)}

 John Bates Clark was one of the pioneers of marginalism and the neoclassical theory of  distribution.  The marginalist approach emphasized the rational decisions of economic agents in allocating their resources would lead them to allocate resources according to the value of the marginal product of the resource in production.  Initially a socialist like George, by 1986 he was praising the dynamical process of competition partly in opposition to the single tax movement George had initiated.  His (1891) ``Distribution as Determined by a Law of Rent,'' argued that, given  competition and homogeneous factors of production labor and capital, the division of the social product will be according to the productivity of the last (or marginal) physical input of units of labor and capital.\footnote{Responding to the "indictment that hangs over society" that it involves "exploiting labor," Clark wrote:

    It is the purpose of this work (his 1899 'Distribution of Wealth) to show that the distribution of the income of society is controlled by a natural law, and that this law, if it worked without friction, would give to every agent of production the amount of wealth which that agent creates. However wages may be adjusted by bargains freely made between individual men (i.e., without labor unions and other "market imperfections", the rates of pay that result from such transactions tend, it is here claimed, to equal that part of the product of industry which is traceable to the labor itself; and however interest (i.e., profit) may be adjusted by similarly free bargaining, it naturally tends to equal the fractional product that is separately traceable to capital.} 
 
Clark's analysis of income distribution does not contradict the classical view of rents, it simply displaces the analysis to the point where a competitive equilibrium prevails, and shifts attention away from the distribution of land rents. Rents are not earned by the marginal unit of land and  





\section{Neoclassical production theory}
The concept of a production function used by increasingly mathematical neoclassical economists and  rapidly developing statistical techniques  naturally led to attempts to identify the precise functional form that would describe the contributions of labour, capital, and income to output.
 
Mathematician Charles Cobb and Economist Paul Douglas came up with a specific and very convenient functional form\footnote{Cobb, C. W.; Douglas, P. H. (1928). "A Theory of Production"  American Economic Review. 18 (Supplement): 139–165. JSTOR 1811556. Retrieved 26 September 2016. The function had apparently previously been used by Knut Wicksell, Philip Wicksteed, and L\'eon Walras.} that captured much of what economists were talking about. The function is just a generalized arithmetic mean:
 
 \[Y=AK^\alpha L^\beta\]
 where $A$ is a constant scale factor, commonly called `Total Factor Productivity. This function becomes the workhorse of neoclassical growth theory in the second half  of the 20th century. Our urban model is a direct heir of those developments.

%The Cobb Douglas function has several convenient features. One is that the sum of the coefficents tells us the degree of returns to scale. If $\alpha+\beta = 1$, we have constant returns to scale,

%Another is that the coefficients of the factors, $\alpha$  and $\beta$ turn out to be the elasticities of output with respect to capital and labour respectively as well as the income share of the factor. These made it relatively easy for economists to combine national data on labour and capital stocks or income with output to test the model.

The Cobb–Douglas form was developed and almost immediately tested against statistical evidence in the USA by Cobb and Douglas between 1927–1947. It was  their widely circulated empirical work seems to have permanently associated this simple function with Cobb and Douglas for economists.

The Cobb-Douglas form captured  important regularities in the cross-sectional national data,\footnote{ A 2021 meta-analysis of 3186 estimates concluded that "the weight of evidence accumulated in the empirical literature emphatically rejects the Cobb-Douglas specification."Gechert, Havranek, Irsova, Kolcunova (2021), "Measuring capital-labor substitution: The importance of method choices and publication bias", Review of Economic Dynamics, doi:10.1016/j.red.2021.05.003, S2CID 236400765. More sophisticated models  such as the CES and translog functions have been developed  since.} 
but the estimates soon showed a systematic bias with time series. Essentially the value of the $A$ seemed to rise over time. Something that was not captured in the initial model  contributed to productivity over time: 
 \[Y=A(t)K^\alpha L^\beta\]



\section{MOVE SECTION BRINGING PRODUCTIVE LAND BACK IN Neoclassical production}

Ricardo analysis of land can be thourght of as:

\begin{equation} 
Y=F(K,L,N).
\label{Eqn:Prod1}
\end{equation} 
where $K$ is capital, $L$ is labour and $N$  is the natural resource  land.

Most modern neoclassical treatments of production have the same basic structure of the production function, but they simplify by omitting land: 

\begin{equation} 
Y=F(K,L).
\label{Eqn:Prod1}
\end{equation} 

    
Which makes sense for a number of reasons. The economy has shifted from agriculture to industry as well as
%Leaving land out of the model makes sense for a variety of reasons. 
And, according to the Ricardian theory, rent is a surplus above cost. It does not, therefore enter into price. Land is a fixed factor for society as a whole that is not consumed in  the process of production.  Furthermore, neoclassical treatments of production focus price determination based on the cost of the last unit used, the marginal  unit of input, while rents are generated on all of the inframarginal units, those units used earlier, which are more productive. The marginal unit of land generates no rents. In neoclassical analysis, the rents disappeared from view for this reason. This difference is at the heart of the distinction between classical and neoclassical economic theory. 

%John B. Davis. Ricardo's Theory of Profit and the Third Edition of the \textit{Principles}. Journal of the History of Economic Thought, 15, Spring 1993. °1993 by the History of Economic Society.
%``Questions arise, however, when one turns to exchange between a sector paying rent and one not.'' The Principles tells us that as cultivation is extended and exchange increases, profits fall while rents increase. 

Leaving land out, however, creates a problem in  the neoclassical growth theories we will examine below. Under the assumption of perfectly competitive goods and factors markets as well as marginal productivity pricing of capital and labor, neoclassical growth requires technical change to be generated outside the model because there are no resources left to innovate if both factors of production are paid their marginal product.\footnote{This follows from Euler’s theorem: if, for a given level of technology $\bar A$ output Y is produced according to a \textbf{constant returns to scale} and twice continuously differentiable function of capital and labor $F(K, L, \bar A)$, Euler’s theorem implies that $F_K K + F_L L=Y$, where $F_i$ is the marginal product of factor $i$. Payments to  capital and labor take up the entire national product and no resources are left to finance the production of technology-improving innovations. are paid their marginal product.} 
If, however, land is reintroduced, as it must be in an urban model, there must be rents and there is therefore as surplus available for innovation.
\footnote{An alternative and common approach is to assume imperfect competition, which may be based on increasing returns to scale, in which case firms with market power may achieve a surplus. ``Although seldom modeled outside the monopolistic competition framework, market incompleteness and imperfect competition are central to the new growth theories'' (Gilles Duranton, Growth and imperfect competition on factor markets: Increasing returns and distribution, European Economic Review, 44-2, 2000, 255-280), Similarly, Sjak Smulders and Theo van de Klundert conclude that ``Growth is higher in a more concentrated market provided that market power of firms is not too high,'' (Imperfect competition, concentration and growth with firm-specific R \& D, European Economic Review, 39-1, 1995,139-160).}

This paper studies the long-run consequences of imperfect competition on growth and the sectoral distribution of skills within an R&D-based growth model with human capital accumulation. We find that steady-state growth is driven only by incentives to accumulate skills. In the model imperfect competition has a positive growth effect, while influencing the allocation of human capital to the different economic activities employing this factor input. Contrary to general wisdom, the share of resources invested in R&D turns out not to be monotonically increasing in the product market power and its correlation with the equilibrium output growth rate is not unambiguous.

%NOTE URBAN COMPETITION PROVIDES INCENTIVES TO UPGRADE SKILLS!!!


% Both the Solow (1956) growth model and its Ramsey–Cass–Koopmans counterpart featuring an endogenous saving rate (Ramsey, 1928; Cass, 1965; Koopmans, 1965) see technical change as purely exogenous. In fact, under the assumption of perfectly competitive goods and factors markets as well as marginal productivity pricing of capital and labor, neoclassical growth requires technical change to be generated outside the model because there are no resources left to innovate if both factors of production. 

%  This follows from Euler’s theorem: if, for a given level of technology $\bar A$ output Y is produced according to a constant returns to scale and twice continuously differentiable function of capital and labor $F(K, L, \bar A)$, Euler’s theorem implies that $F_K K + F_L L=Y$, where $F_i$ is the marginal product of factor $i$. Hence, remunerating capital and labor takes up the entire national product, and no resources are left to finance the production of technology-improving innovations. Accordingly, the growth rate of technology will $\frac{\dot{A}}{A}=g_A$ is necessarily exogenous. %Focusing on balanced growth and 
% assuming that technical progress is labor augmenting (Uzawa, 1961), we can rewrite the production function as $F(K, AL$), where $AL$ is a measure of labor in efficiency units, or effective workers. Let k = K/(AL). Then, output per effective worker is y =Y/(AL)=f (k). Population grows at the constant rate n > 0 and, as we will assume throughout the whole paper, capital does not depreciate. The steady state of the Solow model solves

% $\frac{f(k_{ss}}{k_{ss}} = \frac{n+g_A}{s}kss s$

Classical rent re-appears in neoclassical theory as `economic rent' (``a money payment made for a factor of production that is over and above the minimum payment to keep it in its present use,'')  as quasi-or pseudo-rents (non-equilibrium rents that will be competed away in a competitive equilibrium according to Marshall.\footnote{see Lewis Cecil 4 Rent Under the Assumption of Exhaustibility, Quarterly Journal of Economics, May, 1914, Vol. 28, No. 3 (May, 1914), pp. 466-489}),  as consumer  and producer surplus in supply and demand analysis,  as rent profiles or Pseudo-rent curves in urban theory, as a major concern on resource economics, and the theory of rent-seeking. Economic rent is a surplus insofar as its payment is not necessary to ensure a supply of a particular factor of production. 


% HOUSING RENT IN THE NATIONAL ACCOUNTS
%   Owner-occupied housing is included in Peersonal Consumption Expenditure because the National Income and Producgt Accounts (NIPAs) treat the owner-occupant as if it were a rental business, or in other words, a landlord renting to him or herself. That is, BEA imputes a value for the services of owner-occupied housing (space rent) based on the rents charged for similar tenant-occupied housing, and this value is included in GDP as part of personal consumption expenditures. This imputation is necessary in order for GDP to be invariant when housing units shift between tenant occupancy and owner occupancy.


%Ricardo  clearly understood and used the concept of diminishing marginal product. This shows in his use of the terms ``extensive margin'' and ``intensive margin'' to explain the income of the landowner. He focussed on the difference between the cost of production on a unit of land and the revenue generated. The landlord would rent out all the land which generated at least enough to pay all the costs. Anything in excess of the costs could be charged as land rent to a tenant farmer.



%Clearly in his model there are two basic productive factors, land and labour. The landlord  receives the surplus generated by the land and the rest of the value of production goes to labour. 
Recent urban models, on the other hand, tend to ignore the production process and consider the locational implications of land and transportation costs location of people. Wealth distribution is often ignored.

 \subsection{The Solow-Swann growth model}
In 1956 Robert Solow\footnote{A Contribution to the Theory of Economic Growth,  Robert M. Solow, The Quarterly Journal of Economics, Vol. 70, No. 1 (Feb., 1956), pp. 65-94. Stable URL: http://www.jstor.org/stable/1884513} provided a possible explanation, opening the field for a further series of refinements in an enterprise that became known as ``growth theory.''
\footnote{Solow and his contemporary, Edward F. Denison in his 1961 monograph, \textit{The Sources of Economic Growth in the United States}, were attempting to account for the main features of U.S. economic growth, not to provide a theory of economic development.}%   R.E. Lucas, Jr., On the mechanics of economic development.}

Solow argued ``As a result of exogenous population growth the labor force increases at a constant relative rate n,'' so
  \[L(t)= L_0e^{nt}\] 
If we insert this term into the production function 
 \begin{eqnarray}
 Y&=cK^\alpha (L_0e^{nt})^\beta\\
    &=c(e^{nt})^{\beta}K^\alpha L^\beta\\
  %  &=A(t)K^\alpha L^{1-\alpha} \label{Eq:Solow}
 \end{eqnarray}
we see that $A$ becomes
 \[A(t)=c(e^{nt})^\beta\]
and we have a version of the time-dependent term needed to  allow the model to track the data better. More than half  of the cross-country variation in income can be explained by per capita saving and population growth alone.



%???       It is no surprise that adding a variable allowed the model to track the data better. More  interesting is that the appearance of term $1-\alpha}$ in the scale factor $A$ suggests a spillover effect of human capital on the productivity of other factors.\footnote{Breton, T. R. (2013). "Were Mankiw, Romer, and Weil Right? A Reconciliation of the Micro and Macro Effects of Schooling on Income" (PDF). Macroeconomic Dynamics. 17 (5): 1023–1054. doi:10.1017/S1365100511000824. hdl:10784/578. S2CID 154355849.}  

%The estimated model explained 78\% of the variation in income across countries.
% the estimates of $\beta$ implied that\textbf{ human capital's external effects on national income are greater than its direct effect on workers' salaries.}%(\url{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solow\%E2\%80\%93Swan_model)}.  Theodore Breton provided an insight that reconciled the large effect of human capital from schooling in the Mankiw, Romer, and Weil model with the smaller effect of schooling on workers' salaries. He demonstrated that the mathematical properties of the model include significant external effects between the factors of production because human capital and physical capital are multiplicative factors of production.[20] The external effect of human capital on the productivity of physical capital is evident in the marginal product of physical capital:
%    \[ MPK={\frac {\partial Y}{\partial K}}=\frac {\alpha A^{1-\alpha }(H/L)^{\beta }}{(K/L)^{1-\alpha} }\]


Solow's 1956 paper stimulated a vast literature in the 1960s, exploring many variations on the original one-sector structure. % (per Lucas on mechanics), See Burmeister and Dobell (1970) for an excellent introduction and survey. 
In these models, saving and population growth rates determine the growth trend of the economy. An important  contribution of the neoclassical framework stems from its ability to quantify the effects of various influences on growth. The estimated influences of saving and population growth with the Solow model appear too large, however.%Ludcas on the mechanics of ec dev

if the model was augmented by including human capital $H$, it would fit the data even better.   (Mankiw et al. 1992). Their equation was, in our notation   \[Y=A(t)K^\alpha H^\gamma L^\beta\label{Eq:Mankiw}\] They assume $\alpha+\gamma<1$ which implies decreasing returns to all capital.}

To understand the relation between saving, population growth, and income, it was necessary to go beyond the textbook Solow model, which assumed  diminishing returns to capital and labor separately and constant returns to both factors jointly,

On the Mechanics of Economic Development. Journal of Monetary Economics 22, 1988 3-42} 

% NOTE for  K   
%If we replace the labor-capital technology of the Solow model with a land-labor technology of the same form, and treat labor as the mobile factor and land as the immobile, we obtain a model that predicts exactly the immigration flows that occurred and for exactly the reason - factor price differentials - that motivated these historical flows



One of the predictions of the neoclassical growth model, even  when the concept of capital includes human capital, is that without  continuing improvements in technology, per capita income growth eventually ceases on the equilibrium path. 
By treating technological change as exogenous, neoclassical growth theory could not focus on the fundamental forces which determine long-run growth of nations. Theorists got around the problem to some extent by assuming that technological progress occurs in an exogenous manner. 

The models that followed, starting with Arrow's 1962 model of `learning by doing', introduce human capital and learning in a variety of ways. This is a central insight. Human capital may enter  as a stock that accumulates in the firm or the sector (Arrow (1962), Levhari (1966), and Sheshinski (1967b)) (proxied by aggregate prior capital investment.)
%(Levhari-Sheshinski)as  the experience of workers, the number of units previously produced, 
or the amount of innovation in other firms and sectors. % ( King and Robson )


Identifying  plausible ways that human capital might affect development was relatively easy. Measurement of human capital presents great practical difficulties. To extract the implications of a particular path, it was also necessary to construct a tractable model, analyze its dynamic properties, and find proxy data to test the initial hypothesis.   A series of papers did exactly that.

Kenneth Arrow (1962) gave a dynamic interpretation to increasing returns by emphasizing 'Learning by Doing'. This was an early attempt to render technological progress endogenous in growth models by making the productivity of a given firm an increasing function of cumulative aggregate investment for the industry. Productivity rises with cumulative firm output.


 It is important to note that these models all open the possibility that governments can  promote growth through investment in education, research, technology transfer, and incentives for firms.

\subsection{Endogenous (neoclassical) Growth Models}
A new wave of research on economic growth was stimulated by Romer (1986) and Lucas (1988). In their models, returns to scale are external to single economic agents and internal to a sector or larger parts of the economy. We apply the same insight to urban models to incorporate the growth-enhancing effect of agglomeration. 

%Basically, two branches have developed, pioneered by Romer (1990) and Lucas (1988). CHECK THESE SOURCES

Paul Romer's 1986  model\footnote{ based on his 1983 thesis} describes `learning by investment'. In this model, the increase in total factor productivity depends on firms’ learning, or investment in knowledge accumulation through research, rather than output. He models the incentives for the production of knowledge explicitly. The production function  can be written

\[Y = A(R^T)R^\gamma  K^\alpha L^\beta) \]
Where $R(\equiv R_i)$ is the research effort of the specific firm, and $R^T=\sum_iR_i$ is the total research in the industry,  $R$ is a choice variable for the firm, which is to say, it decides how much to invest in research. 

A notable feature of this model is the spillover effect on all other firms of the firm's investment through the Total Factor Productivity term,  $A(R^T)$. \textbf{This is the logic of our own model of agglomeration effects in the city.}



In 1988 Lucas also argued that technical progress is not exogenous, but endogenous. He proposed a model that is very close technically to the similar models of Arrow (1962), Uzawa (1965)and Romer (1986). Following our notation, 
\[ Y = A(H^e) K^\alpha (HeL)^\beta \] 
where $H^e$ is the economy's average level of skill (human capital).  Improvements in skill in any firm  increase overall productivity.  $HeL$  can be understood as the `effective' labour force of the firm. It is a product of $L$, size of the workforce. $H$, is the skill level of the firm's workers, and $e$, is the fraction of work time spent working. $1-e$ is the fraction of worker time  spent in training. The  special feature is that $e$ is a choice variable for the firm.\footnote{It could as easily be a choice variable for workers in the aggregate model.} More time training increase $H$ but reduces $e$, so the firm faces a tradeoff.


The difference between Romer and Lucas style theories is that endogenous growth in the theory of Romer is caused by accumulating technology (or knowledge), while in Lucas it is through training (accumulating human capital)\footnote{Although it is not of direct concern for our work, it is useful to recognize that much of the emphasis in these models is on finding the conditions that can explain the observed long term  and growth over and above that driven by exogenous population or technology growth. }

%THIS NEXT PARAGRAPH A SIMPLE COPY. FIND SOURCE

Again we see the  internal effects of human capital, where the individual worker undergoing training becomes more productive, and an external or `spillover' effect which increases the productivity of the economy. 
The evidence supports the existence of significant learning spillovers in a variety of industries. Using survey data, Mansfield (1985) found that information about new processes and products in ten industries surveyed had widely diffused within a year. Spillovers have also been found in econometric studies: Irwin and Klenow (1994) find them in semiconductors; Thornton and Thompson (2001) in wartime shipbuilding; Lieberman (1989) in chemicals; Foster and Rosenzweig (1995) in the adoption of high-yielding seed varieties; and Conley and Udry (2007) in the adoption of best practices by Ghanaian pineapple farmers. 

\textbf{ NOTE for Kirsten:  Neoclassical  growth theory predicts that growth rates of different countries with same rates of saving and population growth and with access to the same technology will converge. In  endogenous growth theory there is no force leading to the convergence of growth rates of different countries with closed economies. If the logic extends to urban systems as we believe it does, growth rates of cities will also diverge.}

In all of these models, the unit of analysis is the nation,  or the firm. Lucas has suggested,\footnote{Journal of Monetary Economics 22 (1988) 3-42.  ON THE MECHANICS OF ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT*
Robert E. LUCAS, Jr., University of Chicago, Chicago, 1L 60637, USA}
however, that `` a national economy is a completely arbitrary unit to consider.'' and that ``we know from ordinary experience that there are group interactions that are central to individual productivity and that involve groups larger than the immediate family and smaller than the human race as a whole.''  


As a result, ``following very closely the lead of Jane Jacobs, whose remarkable book The Economy of Cities (1969)'', Lucas goes on to suggest `` that the 'force' we need to postulate account for the central role of cities in economic life is of exactly the same character as the 'external human capital' I have postulated as a force to account for certain features of aggregative development.''  He concludes that if this is so, ``\textbf{\dots land rents should provide an indirect measure of this force (emphasis  ours)}, in much the same way that schooling-induced earnings differentials provide a measure of the productive effects of internal human capital. ''

This insight, which parallels ours, has not been adequately explored, in our view.  Allowing Lucas to expand on his observation, 


\begin{quotation}
    Her emphasis on the role of cities in economic growth stems from the observation that a city, economically, is like the nucleus of an atom: If we postulate only the usual list of economic forces, cities should fly apart. \textbf{The theory of production contains nothing to hold a city together.} (empahsis ours) A city is simply a collection of factors of production - capital, people, and land - and land is always far cheaper outside cities than inside. Why don't capital and people move outside, combining themselves with cheaper land and thereby increasing profits? Of course, people like to live near shopping and shops need to be located near their customers, but circular considerations of this kind explain only shopping centers, not cities. Cities are centered on wholesale trade and primary producers, and a theory that accounts for their existence has to explain why these producers are apparently choosing high rather than low-cost modes of operation.
\end{quotation}

This observation provides a natural link to the scaling literature on cities.


\section{Cities and the Scaling Literature}
Neoclassical production theory does not address the spatial structure of the economy. Why are there cities? What drives the historic transition from land-based agricultural society to a much denser urban society? 

In The Economy of Cities (1969) Jane Jacobs argued that when people come together in cities they make each other more productive. This is in essence, a theory of urban agglomeration that could be written
\begin{equation}\label{eq:LtoN}
Y = A(t) K(t)^\alpha L^\beta 
\end{equation}
where $L$ stands for the size of the urban labour force. Since urban labour force and population are closely correlated, the familiar model is  observationally equivalent to
\begin{equation}\label{eq:N2}
Y = A(t)N^{\alpha+\beta}
\end{equation}
\footnote{ To see why, let  $cN$ be labour employed by capital in firms, where $N$ represents the urban population and  assume a constant capital-labor ratio $1/d$. Replace $K$ with $dcN$
\[Y = A(t) (dcN)^\alpha (cN)^\beta) \]
But  $dc^\alpha$ and $c^\beta$  are simply  multiplicative constants that can be incorporated into the scale factor $A$, so  the function becomes 
\[Y = A(d, c,\alpha, \beta, t)N^{\alpha+\beta}\]
}

A model of a national economy that uses the number of urban dwellers would track as well using the number employed. As countries develop, cities account for an ever-increasing share of  national populations and an ever-increasing share of national income.  This is  even more likely when we recall that the principle insights coming out of neoclassical growth theory point to human capital and education as the mystery factor in growth and cities are where the most skilled workers concentrate and where the strongest educational institutions tend to be. The mysterious contribution to growth pursued in the previous sections might  actually be a consequence of urbanization.

We have conventional diminishing returns to scale  if we impose the standard neoclassical assumption, 
$\alpha +\beta <1 $.\footnote{
The required condition is that 
$Y(\delta K,\delta L< \delta Y(K,L)$. 
In the function that we use to illustrate the models, 
$Y(\delta K,\delta L)= \delta^{\alpha +\beta}Y < Y(K,L)$.} 
That leaves us with a question: what do we need for Equation~\ref{eq:N1} to represent Jacobs' observation?  

The answer lies in making the synergies that Jacobs point to explicit: we require $N$ to generate a spillover effect similar to those  identified in neoclassical growth theory. There are three obvious generic ways to introduce such a term: $N$ can augment $A$, $K$, or $L$, 

NEEDS ALIGNMENT
  
\[Y = A*N^\gamma K^\alpha N^\beta= AK^\alpha N^{\beta+\gamma}\]
\[Y = A (N^\gamma* K)^\alpha  N^\beta= AK^\alpha N^{\beta+\gamma^\alpha}\]
\[Y = A K^\alpha (N^\gamma* N)^\beta= AK^\alpha N^{\beta+\gamma}\]

Each of these yields a form of
\[Y = AN^\psi\]
where $\psi> \alpha +\beta$ and may be greater than one. 
The question now is whether we can find estimates of $\psi$.

The evidence we need comes from another field. Complex systems theory is concerned with identifying and characterizing common design elements that are observed across diverse natural, technological and social complex systems. It focuses on general principles  identified in complex systems across many fields such as biology, physiology, ecology, stock markets, multi-user online  networks, data systems, human settlements.and urban systems.

Scaling analysis is a tool developed in complex systems science to investigate how extensive properties of the system vary with a system's size.  or scale.  In urban science, there are now many studies of  the relationships between urban population size and  features like urban economic output,  area, growth, traffic congestion costs, and even social  indicators like crime and homicide rates. Our particular interest is in studies linking city population  and  economic output. 

The model used is familiar. Omitting subscripts for time, $t$ and city, $i$, \footnote{Bettancourt (2021) writes the model \[Y_i = Y_0(t)N_i(t)^\beta e^{\xi(t)}\]. }
\[Y = Y_0e^{n(t)}N^\beta\]
where $Y_0$ is an initial value. Notice that this looks exactly like the form that we saw in the 
Solow-Swan model with the transform from $K^\alpha L^\beta$ to $N$.  The interpretation is different because the model is used to estimate the parameter $\beta$ and $e^{n(t)}$ is described  as an error term of the form commonly used in estimating multiplicative time-series models. As a result estimates of $\beta$  can be used as estimates  of $\psi$.

The empirical scale factor is a feature of  a static urban system, but, as we have seen it is essentially a growth model. If the population rises, output must rise more than proportionately, but if the population responds to the share of output, the population should then rise. This is a 

Much of growth theory was concerned with identifying the dynamics of such systems and in particular with the implications for the growth of incomes. The growth models, however, were not spatial models, and therefore abstracted from land rents And distribution. They have nothing to say about the distribution of city product and the effect that distribution might have on growth.\footnote{Early models employ a macroeconomic savings function which usually has a fixed savings rate, with savings being reinvested in productive capital. } 

\vspace{2cm}


\section{Does this belong here? Model stages}

Our model has three stages: first, a production function, modeling how urban regions generate wealth,  second a spatial model of an urban housing market, and third, an analysis of distribution within that model 

In this section, we introduce the basic structure of the production side and connect it to the literature on urban scaling. The basic scaling result at the level of the city allows us to incorporate the effect of agglomeration in a standard  circular-city model in a simple way, avoiding the need to explicitly model labour markets and firms.\footnote{Explicitly modeling labour markets and firms is a natural way to specify the model more completely, but it would require introducing many ancillary assumptions and selecting among alternative models of agglomeration, when when we want to focus on distributional and growth-affecting features of the system.}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item to introduce  the productive nature of cities we basically assume the presence of scaling. Given  that the scaling literature gives us an estimate of the economies of scale in a production function this allows us to simplify the model and focus on the features of the urban system rather than on fully specifying a production system. In our model, the city  exhibits economies of scale with respect to population directly. 

     \item  productivity of the city to generates an economic value for land that gives rise to rents

    \item  the rental value of land structures the spatial structure of the city

    \item we exploit the rent model and transport costs to get  distributional consequences
\end{enumerate}

\section{Equilibrium city size  in terms of scale factor} 
At this point we can briefly describe how the discussion of this chapter relates to our overall modelling. There are four basic equations in the model. The first two link output and the wage to population. 






\subsubsection{population and output}
Equation one, following Bettencourt (p65) says that  urban productivity is proportional to population via a scale factor: 
\[Y\propto N^{\beta}\]  
\footnote{ In contemporary US cities productivity increases by about 11\% with each doubling of their population.  Urban Scaling and the Production Function for Cities Lobo J, Bettencourt LMA, Strumsky D, West GB (2013) PLOS ONE 8(3): e58407. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0058407 },
and has both theoretical and empirical support. 

% \begin{tabular}{ll}
% $Y$ is &Aggregate urban output, or GDP \\
% %$\alpha$ & agricultural wage\\
% $G$ is&a `prefactor', possibly time dependent, an initial population\\
%  $N$ is& city population\\
% $ \beta$  is& scale factor, the elasticity of output with respect to city population .\\
% \end{tabular}\vspace{.5cm}

This is illustrated below for $\beta=1.13$.

    \label{fig:scale_output}
    \end{center}
\end{figure}
 
 This figure illustrates a worry for me - the \textbf{average income} - {a proxy for the wage?) rises with $N$ but not more rapidly than transportation costs.
 
\subsubsection{Output and wage}
We need a combination of classical and neoclassical distribution theory.

City output is divided among the classes of society. Neoclassical theory suggests wages are allocated according to marginal product and classical theory suggests rents according to the pattern of ownership.

Equation one, in effect determines a wage, (Given the observed values for the scaling coefficients for total wages and labor, $bW < 1.15$ and $bL < 1$, )  although there are many possible distributional specifications and many possible labour market and firm structures. Bettencourt provides two  estimates,  1.11 and 1.35, for the scale factor for urban personal income in the Brazil and South Africa respectively.\footnote{A more recent  study supports the Bettancourt results for Chiin Wu W, Zhao H, Tan Q, Gao P. An Urban Scaling Estimation Method in a Heterogeneity Variance Perspective. Entropy (Basel). 2019 Mar 28;21(4):337. doi: 10.3390/e21040337. PMID: 33267051; PMCID: PMC7514821.} 

\subsubsection{Wage and city size}
The third determines the extent of the city. This comes form the Alonzo model discussed in chapter XXXXA.

A simple case is the circular city with uniform transportation cost, $t$. \[r^*= \frac{w}{t}\]% A more complex model might have density depend on location, for example, in the continous circular cityt\,
If transportation costs vary by  distance we might have something like this constraint on extent\[w=\int_0^{d*} t(d)dt.\]

This approach imposes an equilibrium condition on the model. It is unnecessary working with a citation of known extent and density. The analytic approach is easily extended to variable transportation cost, although at the expense of additional computational complexity.

\subsubsection{City extent and population}
Equation  four  closes the model by linking the extent of the city to the population. A simple case is the circular city with uniform population $d$, where $d$ is density per unit area and $r^*$ is the radius of the city: \[P=d\pi r^{*2}\] 
More generally, density might vary with for example, the distance $r$ from the centre of the city:
\[P=\pi \int_{0}^{r*}d(r)\,dr\] In a computational model a table of densities would provide the link.
