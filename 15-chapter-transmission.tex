So far, we have introduced the concepts needed to model %the financialization of housing as capturing value created in cities. This lays the groundwork for modeling 
how productivity creates value that is captured by financialization. % This makes it possible study the potential changes in the ownership structure.

However, there is substantial variation in productivity among regions.  This makes it clear that other factors influence the scaling effect. In this chapter, we explore the possibility that the capture of surplus value through financialization is one of the factors that can affect  productivity. We first establish the empirical differences between regions, and then sketch possible channels through which financialization might drive a change in productivity. 


\section{Background}

% There clearly is something too explain, the gap between regions is substantial.
% In this section, we begin by making the case that there is an empirical gap to explain.
Substantial empirical research has shown that there is a gap between regions. In general the relationship between population and output at the urban level follows \cite{loboUrbanScalingProduction2013}:\footnote{We use $\beta$ here because it is the most common form in the literature on urban agglomeration, although when we discuss firm production functions we use $\gamma$, $\alpha$ and $\beta$ for the coefficients on capital and labour respectively, as is most common in the economics literature.}

\begin{equation}\label{eq-agglom-eqn2}
    Y=AN^\beta,\qquad \beta>1. 
\end{equation}
The equation expresses one of the most robust ``stylized facts'' in economics: wealth scales superlinearly with density.  We drew on neoclassical growth theory, in Chapter~\ref{chapter-growth} on growth, to show that a version of this relationship can be derived from a standard neoclassical firm production function of the form: 
\begin{equation}\label{eq-producion-fn-eqn2}
    y=AN^\gamma k^\alpha n^\beta,\qquad \alpha+\beta<1. 
\end{equation}
We use Equation~\ref{eq-producion-fn-eqn2} to model the production sector in our model. The model incorporates an agglomeration effect through both $A$ and $\gamma$. We will use the model to explore how financialization enables capital to capture the surplus value produced in cities by agglomeration effects. This capture affects wealth distribution because it shifts surplus value generated by the urban system itself from residents to owners of capital. % The shift in wealth is of interest in itself, and it is a feature of the modern urban economy. 
% This has interesting potential implications. 
% It may also help explain a significant feature of the empirical results.
This raises the question of whether this shift in resource flows may be driving some of the differences in the scaling of productivity between regions.

% Estimates \cite{mccoskeyPanelDataInvestigation, haryantotriRelationshipUrbanizationEducation2021, pugaMagnitudeCausesAgglomeration2010, loboUrbanScalingProduction2013} of  $\gamma$ and $A$ in Equation~\ref{eq-agglom-eqn2} have revealed 

The considerable variation between regions of $\gamma$ and $A$ \cite{mccoskeyPanelDataInvestigation, haryantotriRelationshipUrbanizationEducation2021, pugaMagnitudeCausesAgglomeration2010, loboUrbanScalingProduction2013} has not yet been adequately explained.\footnote{McCoskey and Kao \cite{mccoskeyPanelDataInvestigation} show that the impact of urbanization on growth varies greatly among countries. The World Bank (2016), for example, reported that every 1\% growth in urban population correlates with an increase in GDP per capita by 13\%, 10\%, and 7\% in India, China, and Thailand, respectively. Indonesia realizes only 4\% GDP growth for every 1\% increase \cite{haryantotriRelationshipUrbanizationEducation2021}.  The literature has not yet settled on an explanation of the variation.  \cite{loboUrbanScalingProduction2013, pugaMagnitudeCausesAgglomeration2010}} 
%\subsection{Small cities may provide clues about impact channels }\label{sec-fig-residuals}
Interestingly the residuals or unexplained components for smaller cities are much larger than they are for large cities, as Figure~\ref{fig-residuals-lobo} from Lobo et all \cite{loboUrbanScalingProduction2013} illustrates.\footnote{The observation suggests that clues about the mechanisms may be found by examining smaller and mid-sized cities and that potential policy impacts may be greater for these cities.}

\end{figure} 
These considerations lead us to consider the question: if financialization is redistributing the surplus generated by the growth of the urban system, could it also affect  productivity of the city itself, explaining the variation identified in the scaling literature? 



 %However, there is variation between regions that has not yet been adequately explained.

%}

There are multiple and variable channels that in theory might link financialization to the magnitude of agglomeration effects in different regions. Figure~\ref{fig-impact-channels} illustrates some of these potential channels.\footnote{The figure shows only some of the links and feedbacks we discuss. Each of the linkages shown or mentioned warrants extensive research, and for most even a brief literature search will reveal many related papers.} 
In the figure, the production sector is on the right, the processes occurring within the city are central, and the speculative intervention in the housing market is to the left. In the upper right, we show the \gls{Alonzo-Jacobs cycle}, described in Chapter~/ref{chapter-model}. In the Alonzo-Jacobs cycle, the strength of the agglomeration effect determines productivity, which in turn drives wages, which determines population which feeds back to agglomeration. In our model, anything that affects productivity must work through the parameters $A$, $\alpha$, $\beta$, or $\gamma$ or through factor supply. 

Any negative effect on urban productivity can have significant consequences at the national level. Over 80 percent of Canadians live in urban centres. Two-thirds of the economic growth in Canada was generated in its six biggest metropolitan areas and about 80\% of the growth comes from the urban areas in total \cite{w.fanImportanceCitiesEmphasis2010}. A reduction of 1.5\% in the productivity growth of these six large metropolitan areas alone would reduce the national growth rate by 1\%. Over 40 years the loss would be equivalent to 33\% of current GDP.

If any of the channels we describe below are significantly affected by financialization, governments may be able to increase social wealth and well-being through policy instruments at affect the level or impact of financialization.

\section{Channels through which financialization may affect productivity}
The literature on financialization generally focuses on the housing market and the social consequences of rising home prices and tenantization.  Relatively few researchers discuss the several possible mechanisms by which financialization might affect the productivity of the city. The fairly preliminary typology we present below is intended to establish that links between financialization and productivity should be explored. We believe that the arguments in this section do establish the plausibility of linkages, but, perhaps because researchers have not looked for links, there is little empirical work to draw on. We will show evidence in our results section that further research on these linkages would be valuable.

%theory suggests a relationship that has not been observed, modelling can help identify the kind of evidend.%ANY THING OVERARCHING WE CAN SAY ABOUT THIS?LATER, IN CONCLUSION YOU SAY : To do this, we identified the housing market channels through which the changes in ownership might be transmitted through the economic and social body of of the city to the Alonso-Jacobs cycle, where agglomeration effects generate wealth.  

\subsection{Reduced capital stock}

Theorists \cite{lefebvreRevolutionUrbaine1970, harveyClassmonopolyRentFinance1974, harveyUrbanProcessCapitalism1978, christophersRevisitingUrbanizationCapital2011}, particularly on the left, have argued that financialization diverts capital investment from productive investment to financial enterprises. The idea is that if more capital is diverted, it doesn't go into investments that increase the productivity of firms over time like equipment, facilities, etc. 

This direct effect is illustrated at the bottom of Figure~\ref{fig-impact-channels}, where capital markets can divert capital from the productive activities on the right to speculative activities on the left. Switching happens in response to the relative rates of return on the two sides. We have assumed a perfectly elastic supply of capital to firms and speculators, leaving modelling more complex and possibly more realistic capital markets to later work. We allow the rate of return on housing investment to rise in response to city growth, however, attracting speculative investment. We could also simulate a falling rate of return on non-housing investment by reducing the cost of capital to investors or by inhibiting the rate of growth of capital on the production side in response to rising investment in housing purchases. % adjK


\subsection{Local investment}

Financialization may reduce the amount of local capital available, reducing investment in local activity. %raising the cost of borrowing money for certain activities in the city, which would make it harder to support the local economic activity. 
There are at least two mechanisms by which local investment capital may be affected. First, if increased tenantization and rent extraction reduce household wealth, we would expect household investment to decline. The decline would probably be correlated with a decline in direct outside investment because when there is less money in a local economy, outside investors tend not to see it as being as worthwhile an investment. %, amplifying its effect. 
This channel would act slowly and persist after an initial round of speculative activity as local housing is bought, and % up be by financial actors. This initial phase of financialization can spark a round of investment as it appears that there is investor interest in the area and housing is getting bought up leading to there being a surge of money circulating in the economy. 
the money circulates in the economy. % and get counted in registers of local activity, encouraging furthur investment.


{\color{red} IS THIS CONTRADICTORY? CLARIFY RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE TWO}
The second mechanism arises because public infrastructure and services are inputs to private production even though they are usually ignored. The transportation network for example can usually be treated as an environmental constant. It is possible that with tenantization the city might have less revenue or less political support for spending on infrastructure, leading to a decline in overall productivity. The opposite might occur as well. 
Municipalities generally spend less on areas with tenants and collect more revenue per capita from rental housing, so tenantization might lead to there being more money available for % rising pressure for 
infrastructure expenditures. 

We can capture these effects by linking the owner-occupier ratio to the capital stock. A more detailed approach might explicitly allocate a share of municipal taxes to increasing agglomeration effects.


\subsection{High-skill labour decline}

Rising housing prices and a market dominated by rentals may make a city less attractive to highly skilled labour, making it more difficult to attract people with the specific adaptive skills needed for productive activities. %Glaeser and Saiz \cite{glaeserRiseSkilledCity2003} identified specific skills that tend to matter. 
Slowing in-migration or increasing out-migration of the more skilled members of the labour force will \textit{ceteris paribus} reduce the effective supply of labour. 
For example, Liu et al. \cite{liuImpactUrbanHousing2023} found for China that an increase in urban housing prices has a crowding-out effect on labour mobility.  Duffy et al.  \cite{duffyRisingHousePrices2005} found that for Ireland that rising house prices, by discouraging potential migrants, could significantly reduce the growth potential of the economy, shifting the balance of labour market growth from employment to wages, with a consequent deterioration in competitiveness. %Anecdotal evidence comes from comes form the frequent news stories about which cities are most livable: low housing prices are almost always an important element in the measures used. (we omit the link form  housing prices to high-skill labour. 


The reduction in highly skilled labour might be offset by importing human capital though immigration or raising wages for talent in the city. Florida\cite{floridaCompetingAgeTalent2005, floridaCreativeClassEconomic2014} has suggested that urban growth is strongly linked to the ability to attract talent. 


There is also a possible counter effect as some of the investment in financialized buy up of land may go towards improving neighbourhoods to attract higher rents.  
While tenantization pushes skilled labour out of neighbourhoods, gentrification can pull it in. Gentrification can be seen as trend opposing tenantization. The effects of tenantization, neighborhood decline and disinvestment, which Cornelissen and Jang-Trettien \cite{cornelissenHousingContextNeighborhood2023} point out are more common than gentrification in low-income neighborhoods, are likely to be opposite of the effects of gentrification. Althobaiti et al \cite{althobaitiHousingPricesSkills2021}  show that with gentrification, high-skill cognitive skills are getting closer to the city center in response to the increase of median housing prices while low-skill physical skills moved further from the center.  

In the model, we can introduce this channel by making the labour elasticity of output in the Cobb-Douglas function, $\beta$, depend on the home-ownership ratio.  

\subsection{The effective wage}

If people have to pay more to live in the city, wages must rise, including wages for those producing goods for the local market. This drives inflation in the city

% that makes other goods and services more expensive.

%inflationary pressures may decrease the effective wage and 
In Figure~\ref{fig-impact-channels)} we can see that inflation, coming from coming from the right side of the diagram may reduce the effective urban wage. Lobo et al. find the effective wage is one of the determinants of growth.  


General financialization may also reduce the bargaining power of labor, as Tomaskovic-Devey and Lin argue \cite{tomaskovic-deveyFinancializationCausesInequality2013}, reducing wages.\footnote{Tomaskovic-Devey and Lin point to a shift in behaviour of non-finance firms away from production and non-financial services and toward financial investments and services. This shift, they argue, has led to lower employment, income transfers to executives and capital owners, and increased inequality among workers \cite{tomaskovic-deveyFinancializationCausesInequality2013}}
%In the second part of the chapter we implement several of the mechanisms and share results. 

% VERY INTERESTING \cite{buchlerImpactHumanCapital2024} in areas with elastic housing supply, the positive demand shock leads to the construction of more housing, a larger labour force, and, thus, moderate wage growth. In contrast, in areas of low housing supply, the positive demand shock has a limited impact on new housing construction and the urban population. Human capital gets capitalised into higher home prices, hindering urban growth.

\subsection{The amenity channel}

Local amenities may also be affected. If the wage of a barista goes up, for instance, the cost of a coffee has to rise. This would not only affect effective wage, but the cafe could also have to close because it can't afford to cover the higher cost of labour. Closing businesses directly affects productivity, but can also reduce the neighbourhood amenity level. 
{\color{red} Urban amenities are part of the incentive for choosing city life for many, and any decline in amenity will have the same qualitative effect as a decrease in the wage.} The size of the effect will vary because people's tastes differ.

\subsection{Impact on the service sector}
As rising housing costs at the centre of a city would tend to push low-wage workers to the edges, we'd expect to see particular impact on the service sector. Financialization might be expected to increase these workers transportation costs, putting further upward pressure on their wages, and thus increasing the costs of those amenity services that rely on lower-cost workers. {\color{red}This would effect productivity HOW ??

\subsection{Reduced investment in human capital}

%There is a vast literature on investment in human capital. 
Growth theory suggests that the growth of human capital is  a major driver of productivity. There are two major ways to grow human capital. One is to increase how many workers there are, i.e. increase the labour supply and the other is to increase their effectiveness by making workers more productive through training, education, etc. Increasingly effective human capital increases returns to scale in the industrial sector and at the national level. Effectiveness of human capital grows faster than the labour supply as a result of increased education, as we described in Chapter~\ref{chapter-growth} section~\ref{section-growth}. 
 
WHY IS THIS HERE? CAN WE CUT SOME OR AT LEAST THE RED? 
Solaki \cite{solakiRelationshipEducationGDP2013} demonstrates a causal relationship between education and growth at the national level {\color{red}and argues that tertiary education should be considered as an exogenous variable.}  Empirical results for Bangladesh \cite{islam2007relationship} show evidence of bidirectional causality between education and growth, which means that means if there's lower education, there's lower growth.  Among others, B\"uchler et al have recently confirmed the important of human capital growth for urban growth.
%Reduced local capital available for reinvestment in human capital might reduce the adaptive capacity of a city's population because people have reduced resources to buffer against challenges.

There are at least two mechanisms by which investment in human capital may be affected by financialization. The most direct is by reducing household incomes. Increasing housing prices increases the wealth of owner-occupiers which may result in increased spending on education for offspring. On the other hand, increased housing costs for tenants may result in reduced human capital investment.\footnote{Glaeser and Saiz found evidence for skill upgrading in declining cities, which suggested to them efficient investment in less skilled workers is a key adaptive/growth mechanism. If powerful enough, this effect might offset some of the negative impacts of financialization we have suggested.} %The effect may be different for different parts of the population. 
In financialized markets, where more occupants are tenants as opposed to owners, this shift could have notable effects. 

Less directly, we suspect financialization will increase the cost of living through, for example, increasing labour costs in the service sector since it raises the cost of living and thus the wages people need to live in the city and work. Higher cost of living that may result in a reduction of the effective wage might also reduce income available for human capital investments. % Rent capture leading to 

We can simulate some human capital effects simply by making a link from the home-ownership ratio to the productivity parameters  $\beta$ and $A$. 



\section{Conclusion}

The dominant effect of financialization is to shift ownership of housing from occupiers to owners of financial capital. In this chapter, we have described a number of the most likely channels through which the effect of financialization might be transmitted to the Alonso-Jacobs cycle, where agglomeration effects generate wealth. Our list is not complete but it provides theoretical grounds for testing the model's sensitivity to a range of policy interventions and lays the foundation for empirical work.  

Understanding the mechanisms has considerable policy importance because it raises the possibility that there are several channels for public policy to enhance the positive effects of agglomeration. Determining the importance of the various impact channels in general or for a specific city is an empirical problem  outside scope of this work. % the brief of this thesis but tests in the universe of the model can lay the foundation for later empirical work.  
The model can however suggest dirrections for future work.

In the Chapter~\ref{chapter-model} we present a model in which we can systematically test the model's sensitivity to a range of policy interventions. % if any spillovers to productivity of the type we discuss here exist. 
In the results section we will further explore, based on our analysis and simulations, how the % unrecognized 
impacts of financialization of the urban housing market may have impact % extremely serious effects on 
the economy as a whole. 

%Financialization may indirectly affect urban productivity at many points in the system. We defer extending the model to include these effects. Our focus in this chapter has been limited to examining possible channels through which the housing market financialization is likely to affect the productivity of a city. 

% We have modeled the relationship between ownership and the inputs to the aggregate production function described in Chapters~\ref{chapter-growth} and \ref{chapter-model}.

% Essentially, the discussion in this chapter has guided and helps explain the policy experiments we have conducted. MAYBE ADD A FINAL SENTENCE PULLING IT ALL TOGETHER?}




% \subsection{TODO ADD BACK MOVE TO TRANSMISSION CHAPTER? The transmission puzzle}

% %The transmission of productivity increases arising from agglomeration effects  to the urban wage through firms, can be modelled in many ways. The agglomeration effects are external to the firm and therefore likely to be unexpected. If  firms underestimate the marginal product of labour, labour productivity will be greater than expected, output will be higher than planned output, and revenue and profits will therefore be higher than expected. Excess demand will attract more productive capital which in turn will demand more labour,  Rising labour demand drives up the wage. The agglomeration effect driving growth is essentially a public good in which individual firms will under-invest. This raises a policy challenge that we leave for others.

% \caption{Multiple marginal products.}
% \label{fig-multiple-marginal-products}
% \end{figure}



% %5Figure~\ref{fig-marginal-products} illustrates the problem. We can  make a distinction between the myopic marginal productivity curve observed  at the shop floor level and  the firm-wide effect of adding a worker. The red curve labeled ``Myopic'' represents the declining direct marginal productivity of labour as  might be observed by a shop manager, who could report how much more output one with one worker one lathe would produce. The blue line above it labeled ``Firm-wide'' represents the actual effect on firm productivity that arises because the new worker makes other workers in the firm more productive. This addition to output would be observable for managers reviewing the firm's performance over time. It might be most easily observed in small firms. 

% %We can go on to consider the slower and distributed effect on closely related firms, which would raise any estimate of marginal product.  If there are 10 other firms and a new worker  has a small spillover effect  $\epsilon$ on each,  the spillovers raise the industry  marginal product  by $10\epsilon$. Each of the  10 other firms  enjoys  an additional $10\epsilon$ gain in the marginal product of their workers. This should lead to additional hiring by other firms.

% %Finally, expanding our view another step, we notice that if each of the  10 other firms hires one worker who produces an additional  $10\epsilon$ gain in output for all firms, the total spillover effect would rise by $100\epsilon$. The social marginal product of a single hire is indicated by the green line.
