description={The word "capital" has many different meanings in economics and finance. Financial capital is simply lendable purchasing power. Owners of financial capital provide their liquidity to borrowers in exchange for a future return. Interest rates are the prices charged for the use of financial capital. It is generally based on (secured by) ownership of tradable assets.  Anything can be a form of financial capital as long as it has a monetary value and can be  used in the pursuit of future revenue. Marx distinguished  financial capital (then called circulating capital or money capital) from fixed or real capital.   }

These interactions produce emergent effects that may differ from the results of traditional, regression-based methods in that, like systems dynamics modeling, it allows for the exploration of complex systems that display non-independence of individuals and feedback loops in causal mechanisms..}

description={ expectations are predictions of future events or values formed by agents for use in decision-making. Agents may form their expectations by looking backward at data on previous values, or by projecting forward using a mental model of how the system works. If agents are fully informed about the state of the system and how it works, their expectations are essentially the same as the predictions of the relevant economic theory and they are termed `rational expectations'.\cite{muthRationalExpectationsTheory1961}. In probability theory, the expected value of a variable is the mean of its true distribution (the rational expectation), which is usually estimated using the observed realizations (a backward-looking estimate).}

\newglossaryentry{urban wage premium}
{
name=urban wage premium,
description={An urban wage premium exists when workers in larger cities earn higher average wages than workers in smaller cities. In both the U.S.  and Sweden a wage premium has been shown to follow a power-law relationship that scales superlinearly with city size. In other words, workers in larger cities not only earn higher average wages, they do so systematically as a power law function of city size. Bettencourt [7] demonstrated theoretically not only that a wage premium should manifest as a power law function, but predicted the value of its exponent. }
