As a discipline it dates back the  16$^{th}$ but is usually associated with the political economists of the mid-18$^{th}$ and  early 19$^{th}$  century like Adam Smith who began to explore the economic implications of free markets and industrialization. Departments of political economy persisted well into the mid 20$^{th}$ C before splitting into separate departments of economics politics.\cite{helleiner20PoliticalEconomy2018}}

\newglossaryentry{price formation}
{
name=price formation,
description={The process of selecting a price based on the conditions in a system. The classic problem is the simple supply and demand model, in which sellers and buyers, each group with its own wants represented by an equation, interact to find a a price. The model  identifies a combination of price and quantity that would be acceptable to both at the same time, but doesn't say how they get to the price. It lacks a price formation mechanism.  \newline The fundamental problem is that the agents don't have complete information and may have limited computational ability, especially with multiple interacting markets. A theory of price formation has to describe the process of adjustment. This is usually represented as a set of individual adjustment rules, which makes any theory of price formation a dynamical system It may not always lead to a steady state equilibrium.}

name=agent-based model,
description={Agent-based models are computer simulations used to study the interactions between people, things, places, and time. They are usually stochastic models built from the `bottom up,' meaning by modelling individual agents (people, institutions, etc). Agents essentially sub-programs that respond to other agents and the environment in certain ways. These interactions produce emergent effects that may differ from the results of traditional, regression-based methods in that, like systems dynamics modeling, it allows for the exploration of complex systems that display non-independence of individuals and feedback loops in causal mechanisms.}

\newglossaryentry{classical rent theory}
{
name=classical rent theory,
description={explained how land generated surplus value for its owner and how this surplus explained the wealth and income of the land-owning class. David Ricardo produced the classic description in 1815 based on extensive prior analysis by others in the preceding century. The key notion is the ``marginal'' unit of land. It is just barely worth putting this land into production because it just barely produces enough to justify the cost of production, and transportation. More productive land or better located land produces a surplus that the landowner  collects in the form of land rent collected from tenant farmers. No tenant would pay to cultivate the  marginal unit of land. The theory employed the basic logic of later the later ``marginalist''  school of economic analysis. = See \gls{class}, \gls{rent}.}

Often described as the difference between the opportunity cost of a factor of production and the income it earns. In this theses we focus on rents generated by \glspl{agglomeration effect}. According to \gls{classical rent theory}, rent is the price paid for the use of land. More generally it is the  surplus generated by any natural resource, up to and including the athletic talents of basketball stars.\cite{lackmanClassicalBaseModern1976} Land, talent and mineral resources are seen as ``the free gift of nature'', forms of capital which the owners do not create but do appropriate. Like the productivity of agricultural land in classical theory,  urban \gls{agglomeration effect}s produce land rents that are not created but are appropriated by the landowners. See \gls{class}.}
