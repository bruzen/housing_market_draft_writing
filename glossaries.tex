\newglossaryentry{marginal}
{
name=marginal,
description={relating to or situated at the edge or margin of something. In the marginalist approach to economics, it  refers to technique of focusing on the cost or benefit of the next unit or individual.}
}

\newglossaryentry{inframarginal}
{
name=inframarginal,
description={coming before the margin is reached. For example, if the wage is $x$, all workers willing to work for less than $x$ are inframarginal. They are selling their time for more that it is worth to them. The come out ahead on the bargain. Workers who will work for $x$ but not a penny less are marginal. }
}

\newglossaryentry{subsistence wage}
{
name=subsistence wage,
description={wage which covers the cost of buildings, food and other living costs and a base cost of land. This base cost is usually described as the cost of agricultural land. It is more precisely described as the opportunity cost of urban land, and we have simply extended the technique to include the opportunity cost of urban labour. }
}

\newglossaryentry{rent premium}
{
name=rent premium,
description={the excess rent  that might be charge for the use of urban land relative the non-urban land. In our model the rent premium is equal to the wage premium. }
}

\newglossaryentry{warranted rent}
{
name=warranted rent,
description={$\mathcal{R}_N$ at an  urban location  $d$ units from the centre, is the general rent premium (= the wage premium) minus transportation costs, $\omega-\tau d$).  }
}


\newglossaryentry{overlapping generations model}
{
name=overlapping generations model,
description={in the OLG model individuals live a finite length of time, long enough to overlap with at least one period of another agent's life. The OLG model is the natural framework for the study of the life-cycle behavior (investment in human capital, work and saving for retirement).}

\newglossaryentry{urban wage premium}
{
name=urban wage premium,
description={An urban wage premium exists when workers in larger cities earn higher average wages than workers in smaller cities. In both the U.S.  and Sweden a wage premium has been shown to follow a power-law relationship that scales superlinearly with city size. In other words, workers in larger cities not only earn higher average wages, they do so systematically as a power law function of city size. Bettencourt [7] demonstrated theoretically not only that a wage premium should manifest as a power law function, but predicted the value of its exponent. }

\newglossaryentry{Alonzo model}
{
name=Alonzo model,
description={also called the Alonso-Muth model. The model credited to William Alonzo, A full development of the theory is presented in his doctoral dissertation, A MODEL OF THE URBAN LAND MARKET: LOCATIONS AND DENSITIES OF DWELLINGS AND BUSINESSES, University of Pennsylvania, 1960. }
}

\newglossaryentry{asking price}
{
name=asking price,
description={the price a seller initially posts on deciding to sell a property. It will be higher than the seller's maximum bid price.}
}

\newglossaryentry{reservation price}
{
name=reservation  price,
description={The lowest price that a prospective seller will accept, which is computed as  seller's maximum bid price, which would incorporate the net rent achievable.}
}

\newglossaryentry{bid price}
{
name=hysteresis,
description={in  the computational model, any price that an agent bids for a property in the transaction process. It will be less than or equal to the agent's maximum bid price and less than or equal to the asking price.}
}

\newglossaryentry{maximum bid price}
{
name=hysteresis,
description={the maximum price that investors will bid for a property. A bid that makes the expected return exactly the required or  target return.}
}

\newglossaryentry{bargaining}
{
name=bargaining,
description= {in the computational model during price setting for a particular property, there is a bargaining process that takes as arguments the highest bid price, reservation price, and asking price, returning a sale price for the property, as well as property transfer instructions.}
}
%The reservationn prices  is  the seller  own bid. If the max bid of the highest bid received is lower than the own bid the seller is the buyer- remains the owner. 
%Otherwisesimplest rule is  (reservation bid+maxbid)/2

\newglossaryentry{distribution}
{
name=distribution,
description={The way total output, income, wealth or assets is distributed among individuals or among the factors of production (such as labour, land, and capital), or the empirical distribution of any of these across the population.
