\newglossaryentry{subsistence frontier}
{
name=subsistence frontier,
description={The minimum income or lowest standard of living that can sustain people in the economy. Rather than thinking of the limit as a single value---say the minimum survival income---it is more realistic to recognize that the limit can be achieved with different combinations of goods. For example, if clean water is freely available in a local stream, the subsistence income does not include the cost of bottled water. All the combinations can be seen as a \gls{frontier}. \newline In classical economics, the frontier was summarized as a subsistence wage. Subsistence theorists like Malthus argued that the market price of labour would not vary from the natural price for long: if wages rose above subsistence, the number of workers would increase and bring the wage rates down. The classical economist recognized that the limit was in part set by social convention, but it was analytically convenient to assume a subsistence wage, and it could be argued, following Malthus that a subsistence wage  represented a long-term limit or \gls{equilibrium}. As an analytical convenience in our model, we employ a subsistence wage that includes housing and a conventional standard of living.  }

\newglossaryentry{price formation}
{
name=price formation,
description={The process of selecting a price based on the conditions in a system. The classic problem is the simple supply and demand model, in which sellers and buyers, each group with its own wants represented by an equation, interact to find a a price. The model  identifies a combination of price and quantity that would be acceptable to both at the same time, but doesn't say how they get to the price. It lacks a price formation mechanism.  \newline The fundamental problem is that the agents don't have complete information and may have limited computational ability, especially with multiple interacting markets. A theory of price formation has to describe the process of adjustment. This is usually represented as a set of individual adjustment rules, which makes any theory of price formation a dynamical system It may not always lead to a steady state equilibrium.}

It is just barely worth putting this land into production because it just barely produces enough to justify the cost of production, and transportation. More productive land or better located land produces a surplus that the landowner  collects in the form of land rent collected from tenant farmers.
