name=classical rent theory,
description={explained how land generated surplus value for its owner and how this surplus explained the wealth and income of the land-owning class. David Ricardo produced the classic description in 1815 based on extensive prior analysis by others in the preceding century. The key notion is the ``marginal'' unit of land. It is just barely worth putting this land into production because it just barely produces enough to justify the cost of production, and transportation. More productive land or better located land produces a surplus that the landowner  collects in the form of land rent collected from tenant farmers. No tenant would pay to cultivate the  marginal unit of land. The theory employed the basic logic of later the later ``marginalist''  school of economic analysis. = See \gls{class}, \gls{rent}.}

More generally it is the  surplus generated by any natural resource, up to and including the athletic talents of basketball stars.\cite{lackmanClassicalBaseModern1976} Land, talent and mineral resources are seen as ``the free gift of nature'', forms of capital which the owners do not create but do appropriate.
