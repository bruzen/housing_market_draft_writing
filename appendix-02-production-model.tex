\chapter{Firm model}
Our treatment of the urban surplus which is central to this thesis, is illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig:Agglomeration-surplus}. In the lower left, we illustrate a single firm with decreasing returns to scale operating at its optimal scale, $n$. The thick diagonal line represents the effect of increasing the number of firms operating at the optimal scale. It is the constant returns (CRS) line. If congestion effects from bringing a large number of firms together were dominant, a city would exhibit decreasing returns to  scale,  $N$, and agglomeration would not occur. Research indicates that cities exhibit increasing returns to scale, illustrated by the upper line, which shows the city generating an increasing surplus as it grows, which is the increasing returns to scale case. The curvature of the line is determined by a function of the form $N^\gamma$, which we include in the production function for urban firms. 

In this section we are describing how we embed a model of diminishing returns to scale firms within an increasing returns to scale economy. 

We assume there are many firms operating at their optimal scale in both the rural and urban sector, but the production function of the urban firm is augmented by the term $N^\gamma$. 

NOTE ON EXPONENTS

\begin{figure}[htb]
    \centering
\input{fig/production_functions}
    \caption{While each individual firm exhibits decreasing returns to scale, the city as a whole exhibits increasing returns to scale, and thus produces an agglomeration surplus, $A(N^\beta)-\frac{N}{n}Y_F$.}
    \label{fig:Agglomeration-surplus}
\end{figure}

We need to distinguish the parameters of production functions for rural and urban firms and for the city as a whole. We assume that  rural and  urban firms use the same Cobb-Douglas technology ${y}=A_Fk^{\alpha_F}n^{\beta_F}$. The difference is that the urban firm enjoy a  multiplicative agglomeration externality $N^\gamma$, so ${y}=A_FN^\gamma  k^{\alpha_F}n^{\beta_F}$. We  $\gamma$ is zero for the rural firm.

We set $\alpha_F$ and $\beta_F$ as a parameters, but will have to calculate a value for $\gamma$ consistent with the strength of the agglomeration effects. 


In addition, there is an aggregate production function for the city from the scaling literature which we write $Y=AN^\beta$. Where $\beta$ for the city as a whole, differs from $\beta_F$ for the individual firm, because of agglomeration effects. % $\beta$ is not the same as the value of $\beta_F$ in the firm's production function. We omit the subscript $C$ for city from  the aggregate production function.    


\section{Where do we start?}
In each period we have the size of the existing workforce $N$ and the number of firms $F$ and $k_t$. \footnote{We also inherit the size of the existing firms. We can simplify by firms do not change their capital stocks as wages change. This would be incorrect but would do as a first approximation.}

\subsubsection{Urban firms' employment} 
Aggregate labour supply is established by the process  above.  Available workers are divided among existing firms.   \begin{equation}
    n_t= \frac{N_t}{F_t} 
\end{equation}

From this, using the production function we can calculate the both output and  $MPL_t$.

\subsubsection{Urban firms' output}
\begin{equation}
    {y}_t=A_FN_t^\gamma k_t^{\alpha_F}n_t^{\beta_F} \label{eqn-urban-firm-output}
\end{equation}

\subsubsection{Urban firms'  marginal product of labour}

The output equation, above, differentiated with respect to  $n$, and simplifying by substituting back in $y_t/n_t$. %n^epxonent -1 pull out and put n underneath
\begin{equation}MPL_{t} = \frac{\beta_{F}{y}_{t}} {n_t} \label{eqn-urban-firm-mpl}
\end{equation} 

This is used to calculate target employment.

Firms observe their output, ${y}_t$ and find their $MPL_t$. They want to adjust labour so that the $MPL_t$ is equal to the wage. 

\subsubsection{Urban firms' marginal product of capital} 
Compute the marginal product of capital, similarly, differentiating the output equation:
\begin{equation} MPK_t = \frac{\alpha_{F}{y}_{t}}{k_{t}} \label{eqn-urban-firm-mpk}
\end{equation} 
This is used to calculate target capital stock and the number of new firms.


\section{Planning for the next period}

\subsubsection{Aggregate urban labour demand} 
Aggregate urban labour demand for the following period has two parts--the demand of existing firms and the demand of new entrants. 
\begin{equation}
N_{total}= N_{exist}+N_{new}
\end{equation}


In each case, the firms sets hiring targets, it may or may not achieve. We begin by calculating targets for existing firm employment and capital. 

 
\subsubsection{Urban firms' target employment} 
Firms examine their own output and marginal product of labour, all calculated with values determined in the previous period. 
Following the  optimality rule, for profit maximizing firms, the marginal product of labour should equal the wage, $MPL_t= {\omega_t + \psi}$, however it doesn't because urban output includes the urban agglomeration effect. Effectively firms, take into account the effect due their own increase in labour, but don't take into account the overall effect on  productivity increase through $N_t^\gamma$ due to every other firm increasing their labour force at the same time. Firms thus compute a target value for $n_{t+1}$ based on the realized output assuming the current wage. %Substituting the wage into Equation~\ref{eqn-urban-firm-mpl} for $MPL$: % They act like they are not changing the labour market by hiring more, however all firms hiring will actually affect the required wage, and they'll have to go back to revisit it. This uses simple equations to capture the dynamics of an itterative market process. 
\begin{equation} n^{target}_{t+1}= \frac{\beta_F {y}_{t}}{\omega_t + \psi} \label{eqn-urban-firm-target}
\end{equation}


%\subsubsection{number of firms}  Firm formation uses current variables to set number of firms for the next period. Decisions to enter or leave in the next period are based on current values. 
% \begin{equation}F_{t}=\frac{N_{t-1}}{n^{target}_{t-1}}\end{equation}
% . An increase in the number of firms adds to labour demand: 
% \begin{equation}
%     new\ firm\ demand = n^{target}_{t-1}(F_{t}-F_{t-1})
% \end{equation}


\subsubsection{Urban firms' target capital} 

Firms also find their target marginal product of capital, $MPK_t$ based on the target labour force. 

\begin{equation}
    {y}_t^{target}=A_FN_t^\gamma k_t^{\alpha_F} (n_t^{target})^{\beta_F} \label{eqn-urban-firm-output}
\end{equation}


The revised $MPK$ should equal their cost of capital, $r_F$. % and adjust the capital stock so that the MPK$_t$ is equal to $r_F$. 

\begin{equation}k_{t+1}^{target}= \frac{\alpha_{F}{y}^{target}_{t}}{r_F},\end{equation}



 $y_t^{target}$  is calculated using $n^{target}_{t+1}$. % into Equation~\ref{eqn-urban-firm-output}.

It is based on planned output using planned labour rather than the labour available in the period, so we begin with the marginal productivity of labour equation, 
which gives us 



\subsubsection{Aggregate urban labour demand of existing firms} 

The firms are identical, so the aggregate urban labour demand for existing firms increases in proportion to firm labour demand:

\begin{equation}N_{exist,t+1}^{target} = \frac{n^{target}_{t+1}}{n_{t}} N_t\end{equation}   
 % (This should be the same result as  multiplying $n^{target}_{t+1} \times F_{t} $.)

% Y is produced with the year's realized workforce.

\subsubsection{Additional urban labour demand for new firms}
If  $MPK_t > r_F$  firms are making a profit and standard micro theory tells us new firms will enter the market $dF/dt >0$. The converse is true as well: $MPK_t > r_F \rightarrow dF/dt <0$. Theory tells us nothing about how many except that this adjustment will almost certainly be much slower than the adjustment of the labour market adjustment rate, $\frac{n^{target}_{t+1}}{n_{t}}$. If we (arbitrarily) assume the rate is 0.25  of the labour market adjustment rate, 
\begin{equation}
F_{exist,t+1}= 0.25\frac{n^{target}_{t+1}}{n_{t}}F_t
\end{equation} 
The value 0.25 is a measure of the ease of entry into the market.
 


\subsubsection{Total aggregate urban labour demand of existing and new firms $N_{T,t+1}^{target}$} 
Total labour demand will be\footnote{We could  directly calculate aggregate labour demand:
\begin{equation}
  N_{total,t+1}^{target}= \frac {\omega_{t-1}} {\omega_{t}} N_t \nonumber
\end{equation}
However, in the agent model the agents decide whether to work in the urban market individually, considering the wage and transportation costs.
}
\begin{equation}N_{total,t+1}^{target} = 1.25\frac{n^{target}_{t+1}}{n_{t}} N_t\end{equation}  

% Target employment 
% This is used in bellow to calculate next period employment and wage premium.




\subsubsection{New firm labour demand,  $N_{new, t+1}$} 
The number of firms will also adjust for the following period.\footnote{There are additional second-order adjustments we could consider. Firms will increase their capital stock and reduce their labour force in response to rising labour costs. At the same time, increasing employment will shift the marginal productivity curve outward.}
Firms enter when $MPL$ is greater than the wage, %, $MPL > wage$, which with existing technology 
permitting profit making with existing technology. For simplicity, new firms set the same target employment as existing firms. 
\begin{equation}N_{new, t+1}^{target} = n_{t+1}^{target} F_{new, t+1} = n_{t+1}^{target}Z\frac{MPL_t- (\omega_t + \psi)}{\omega_t +\psi}F_{t}\end{equation}
where $Z\in\{0\dots\infty\}$ is an adjustment parameter. The number of entrants as a fraction of the existing number of firms is larger when the profit margin is larger.

\subsubsection{Number of firm adjustment} 
\begin{equation}
F_{total, t+1}=\frac{N_{total,t+1}^{target}}{n^{target}_{t+1}}
\end{equation}
This adjusts over time, keeping the firm labour force near the optimal level. 

\section{The adjustment process}
In conventional economic analysis of markets with many firms, in order to compute an equilibrium, firms are treated as price takers. In an ABM equilibrium is not imposed. Realistically, firms must raise their wage offer to get more workers. New workers have to be induced to enter the market. We do not model the wage bargaining process, however. We simply introduce a plausible adjustment process that takes account of both the firm's demand and the actual supply constraints.  

%Given target labour demand, firm numbers, firms must adjust the wage to bid for new workers.

The simplest version of our story is that the profit-maximizing price-taking firms make a decision to expand employment at a given wage. They do so because realized labour productivity is higher than expected,  a result of agglomeration effects.

%To capture the iterative dynamics of the market, 
% Individual firms have limited market power and we model of them as thinking of themselves as price-takers. 
Firms need not take into account that if they all increase labour demanded, wages must rise. We know that the actual supply curve, however, is constrained by the transportation cost. In our ABM with uniform density, population is simply the square of twice the distance that workers will travel for a given wage premium: $N=density*2(\omega/c)^2$.\footnote{The greatest distance  an agent will travel to work in the city is $\omega/c$. This results in an area of $2(\omega/c)^2$. With the block metric for travel, the area is a square with a diagonal length of $2\omega/c$. Using Pythagoras the side of the square is $\sqrt(2)\omega/c$, and the given area is the square of that value.} %Aggregate target employment is then $N_{t+}^{target} = F_t^{target} n_t^{target}= density*2(\omega/c)^2$. 
Solving for $\omega$ in terms of $N$, %=F_{t+1}^{target} n_{t+1}^{target}$ 
gives us the target urban labour supply curve, 

\begin{equation}
   \omega= c\sqrt{\frac{N}{2 * density}}
\label{eqn:Labour-supply}\end{equation}

    \label{fig:cobweb}
\end{figure}



Adjustment of the labour market can be modelled as a cobweb process, as illustrated in the simplified cobweb Figure~\ref{fig:cobweb} converging to an equilibrium value. It is clear from the figure that the result of the market adjustment is that firms will be able to hire fewer than they targeted and at a higher wage than they had enjoyed. To simplify the model we use a simple partial-adjustment-to-equilibrium  rather than fully specifying  firms as agents.\footnote{The  slopes of the demand and supply curve can be calculated by differentiating labour supply(Equation~\ref{eqn:Labour-supply}) and MPL (Equation~\ref{eqn-urban-firm-mpl}) functions with respect to $N$. For example, using  $\die{\omega^s}{N}=\die{c\sqrt{\frac{N^{target}_{t+1}}{2 * density}}} {N}$ we can approximate a discrete change along the supply curve  by multiplying the partial derivative by the discrete change in change labour demanded: 
\[ \Delta \omega_{t+1}^{target}= \frac{ c} {2\sqrt{2 N* density}}(N_{Total,t+1}^{target}-N_t)\]
Additional computations would allow us to find an exact adjustment-to-equilibrium value, but in ABMs we  do not impose equilibrium conditions or expect equilibrium to be achieved in any period. Furthermore, retaining the partial adjustment parameter gives us additional control of the adjustment dynamics.} 

\begin{equation}
\omega_{t+1}= (1-adj)\omega_{t} + adj\ \omega^{target}_{t+1}
\end{equation}
where $0\le adj \le 1$ is the partial adjustment factor coefficient
.\footnote{We could implement the wage adjustment in a more sophisticated way. For instance, the wage the firm would offer new workers may adjust toward the marginal product of labour for the firm: % while exiting workers' wages are unchanged:
\begin{equation}wage_{new,t+1}= (1-adj_{new})\omega_{new,t} + adj_{new} MPL_{t}  +\psi, \end{equation}
where $adj_{new}$ is parameter controlling the speed at which the wage for new hires adjusts. 
Existing workers are likely to demand catch-up increases if new workers receive higher wages:
\begin{equation} wage_{exist,t+1}= (1-adj_{exist}) \omega_{exist, t-1} + adj_{exist} wage_{exist,t}  +\psi, \end{equation}
where $adj_{exist}$ is a parameter controlling the speed at which the wage for existing workers adjusts toward the wage of new workers.

% Do we have to worry about workers switching firms? Would switchers get the full bid new workers get? I think the answer is yes. 
If a fraction of workers switched to get the full bid new workers get, it would have two effects. The catch-up ratio would be higher and the new workers hired would include workers from other firms. The target employment for the firm would not change, nor would the number of persons moving to the city in response to the higher wage. Only if the labour market were sticky would this have an effect.

A slow immigration response would have additional effect.
% This suggests that all workers could get the same wage. 
Slow wage adjustment for existing workers would increase firm profitability and might make hiring more attractive, speeding the firm's growth.}

% \subsubsection{Wage adjustment} 

% \textbf{Wage calculation}
% Firms make one decision faced with a market wage. They choose a target workforce. This is typical in \glspl{competitive market} where firms are price-takers. 


% When \textbf{aggregate} firm labour demand exceeds N, wages rise at the city level

% To get labour supply $N^s$ in terms of  $\omega$ we combine $N=f^2 *density$ and $f=2\omega/c$. 



\footnote{What happens if housing is not available? Maybe workers can't come to the city until the housing stock adjusts. Firms have labour shortages.  The wage stays high or may rise more. House prices will rise.} 

\footnote{What if only new workers get the new wage? This is interesting: firms will make excess profits. New firms will be attracted by excess profits but may not be able to get workers at the old wage.}


% Common to think of the variations in local wages as variations around a mean, in this context - perfect labour market.
% We're using this number at the aggregate level, raise the market wage to a level that attracts that many. Divide available workers among the firms, then they want to raise the wage again. It's more transparent to do it at the aggregate level than at the firm level, but we still have the rising supply curve. A more detailed agent model could implement the hiring and wage adjustment mechanisms for firms directly, but the side effect of increased complication is it also can obscure the clarity of the rent results, our focus with this work. 



\section{Firm initial values}

\subsubsection{Firm $Y_{F,i}=A_Fk_i^\alpha n_i^{\beta_F}$}
We use the familiar Cobb-Douglas production function \cite{chiangFundamentalMethodsMathematical2002} to set relationships among variables that are consistent with basic neoclassical production theory. 
\begin{description}

\item[initial urban wage premium] = $\omega_0 = (wage\_premium\_ratio) * \psi = p*\psi $, where $p$ is selected to provide a plausible initial relationship between $\psi$ and $\omega$. $p$ will vary as $\omega$ evolves. 

\item[initial labour force for urban firms] $n_0=n_R$.  Initially, we will try values similar to the rural firm size and allow it to adjust.  %*****%may have implica=tions later for the notation

\item[Initial wage premium] $\omega_0=p_0*\psi$

\item[Initial urban wage] = $\omega_0=\omega_t +\psi =(1+p_0)\psi)$
%The wage  is set as the marginal product of labour for initialization of the model. 

\item[labour cost for typical rural firm] $L_R = n_R*\psi$. This is expressed as a money quantity: e.g., 100 workers * \$40,000/worker. We do not include other labour costs or taxes. 

% \item[Initial labour cost for typical urban firm] ]  $L_U = n_R(\psi+\omega_0)$.

\item[output for typical rural firm]  
\[Y_R=\frac{n_R*\psi}{\beta_F}\]
In our model, this is a constant for any initial values on the RHS. Derived from the marginal productivity condition. See item~\ref{item-paramlist-firm-level} in the orange  block. The numerical calculation is done  for a firm with 100 workers and a marginal product of labour of $\psi$. %I get \$20 million for those values. 


\item[initial output for an urban firm] 
\[Y_0^U=N_0^\gamma Y^R\]  
Taking the marginal product with respect to $n$, we get a useful fact that will allow us to tie down $\gamma$
\[Y_{U,0}=\frac{n*(\psi+\omega)}{\beta_F}\]

\item[capital for typical rural firm] (Derived from the marginal productivity condition.)
\[k_R=  \frac{\alpha_R Y_R }{r}\]
This is also a constant.
 
\item[initial capital for an urban firm] (Derived from the marginal productivity condition.)
\[k_{U,0}=  \frac{\alpha Y_{U,0} }{r}\]
This differs from capital  for the rural firm because of the term $n^\gamma$. 

\item[scale factor A for typical  firm] 
\[A_F= \frac{Y_R}{k_R^{\alpha} {n\psi}^{\beta_F}}\]
We will assume that this is a constant used for both rural and urban production functions. (The explicit function is a bit  messy but the numeric value is easily computed because we have $L_r=n_R\psi$, and have calculated $Y_F$, and  $K_F$). The prefactor.

\end{description}
% \textbf{NOTE: With the initial values calculated in this section $\omega$ is consistent with $N_0$.as a result, population should not grow.}

\section{Firm level production}  
 \textbf{This section includes numerical examples. It has been commented out}
(This is incorporated above.) We want the marginal product of labour in the rural economy at the firm level to be at least close to \$40,000.  We can create a generic rural firm and then consider an urban firm with agglomeration effects to get the parameters we need. 

Firm employment $L$ is small relative to  urban employment {N}. Assume it is 100 workers. 

Assume that the rural production function is 

\[ Y_{iF}^R=A_{F} K^{\alpha_F} L_F^{\beta_F} \]

where $Y$ is the value of output, $L_F=n*\psi$, $K=r*k$
.\footnote{These values give us diminishing marginal product at the firm level. If we require product exhaustion we have factor shares of  0.8 and 0.2.The tricky point is that factor share are 
 $\frac{\alpha}{\alpha + \beta}$ and $\frac{\beta}{\alpha + \beta}$
(*If not there is surplus profit  which we will ignore.)}
Further assume that $\alpha_F=0.18 $,  and $\beta_F=0.76$. Notice that the value-MPL is the partial derivative with respect to $n$ and not L. 
The marginal products of labour and capital are 
\[MPL=n*\beta_F Y_F/L_F=\$40,000\] and\[\ MPK=\alpha_F Y_F/K_F =0.05\]
From the equation for the marginal product of labour, using the hypothetical initial values, we get a value of output for our rural firm:

\[Y_F=\frac{n*\psi}{\beta_F}=\frac{100*\$40,000}{0.72}=\$5,555,556\]
This is firm revenue. From the MPK, we get the value of capital used by the firm.\footnote{The firm pays 5\% per year in capital costs,.} 

\[K_F=  \frac{\alpha_F Y_F }{r}=\frac{0.18 *\$5.5555\ million}{0.05} =\$20\ million \]

We now have the capital, labour and output for a model firm with a marginal product of labour  equal to the subsistence wage we have chosen. We can calculate the \textbf{scale factor} $A$.
{\color{red}
\begin{equation}  
A_F= \frac{Y_F}{K^{\alpha_F} L^{\beta_F}}=\frac{5,555,000}
{(0.05*20,000,000)^{\alpha_F} (40,000*100)^{\beta_F}} =53.34721 \label{eqn-AR}\end{equation} 
}
%
$A_F$ can be computed using equation~\ref{eqn-AR} for any set of coefficients and firm size.\footnote{Furthermore, we can compute the output for a city of size N if it consists of $N/n$ firms of this type. With a population of, for example 10,000. Based on the model of the rural firm above,   there would have to be  100 firms and an output of \$555,555,600$N^\gamma$. This is offered simply to see if the initial values we work with are plausible.}

 \subsubsection{The urban level of production}
% \textbf{This section now redundant and has been commented out}
We now consider a firm with the same production function that operates in the city and enjoys  urban agglomeration benefits as an externality. The value of the  marginal product of labour must rise to $\psi+\omega$. We to know  the urban wage premium that is consistent with the subsistence wage. \footnote{Papageorgiou \cite{papageorgiouOccupationalMatchingCities2022} found a 4.1\% premium. D'costa and Overman   show that working in London is associated with a 35.5\% higher wage than working in a rural area. The comparable figures are 10.6\% for big cities and 8.3\% for small cities and an elasticity of wages with respect to city size of 1.6\%.. Estimates of the premium are lower  when controlling for individual city characteristics.}   

If the scale coefficient =.12 $=\omega$ would be $1.12*\psi$, or $4,800$.


We need to have a population size or a number of firms with a firm size. Assume the population is 10,000 and firms still have 100 workers. (All firms will have the same marginal product of labour in a competitive labour market, so using a representative firm should not affect our calculated values .)

\[y_C=A_F N^\gamma k^\alpha n^\beta = N^\gamma y_R\]
where $N^\gamma$ represents the agglomeration effect. This assumes that all of urban production is generated by the firms and they use the same quantities of capital and labour a rural firms. Total urban production is then approximately $Fy_C=FN^\gamma y_R $ , where F is the number of firms.

The marginal product of labour is 
\[MPL^u=\$44,800=N^\gamma \beta y^R/L=N^\gamma *\$40,000\]
so $N^\gamma= 1.12$ and $\gamma = \frac{log(1.12)}{log(10,000)} =.012$. 

{\color{red}
To get a  $\gamma$  consistent with an empirical  value for  the wage premium  $\omega/\psi$\%, 
\begin{equation}
\gamma= \frac{log(1+\omega/\psi)}{log(N_0)}\label{eqn:gamma-define}\end{equation}
}

This value is consistent with an empirical  value for  beta_city (the urban scale exponent) of $\beta =  1.012$. The value is much lower than empirical estimates. Furthermore, if we consider the same firm structure and a population of one , the value falls, which suggests that agglomeration effects are not scale-independent, but instead increase with urban size. $\beta$ may itself be a function of $N$.

% A second interesting possible implication of our calculation is that only part of the agglomeration effect appears in wages. Urban rents  are large, but agglomeration effects are much larger.

Leveraging this differential profitability, they estimate that 36\% of multinational profits are shifted to tax havens globally. US multinationals shift twice as much profit as other multinationals relative to the size of their foreign earnings.}

\begin{enumerate}
\item To start with a population of around 10,000, we begin with width = 10, height = 10 and \textbf{density} per unit of 100. 

\item If we arbitrarily assume an initial wage premium around 20\%, and wish to start near equilibrium, % bettencourt assumed aggomeration exponent is indepent)
we can select transportation costs. A transportation cost of 0.1  would give a distance of $\omega/.01$, which is huge. Could this be 1/10 of the starting wage premium $\omega_0$? It would then be \$800 per year, per unit distance and would give us height and width of 10. 
% (divide into omega) - we want to start close to equilibirum. omega/cost = width
\item We should have a 20\% wage premium of about \$8000 to be consistent with the subsistance wage. % since we are assuming the wage premium of around 20%. Total wage has to be subsistence wage + wage premium, think of an average rural subistance wage seems like 45K .. 

\item Your proposed prefactor was 0.2,  251. It should be very large, based on the above numbers and the consistency constraints. I get 1507 in appendix-05-agglomeration model
