INTRODUCTION

QUOTE THAT THERE'S A housing pricis--

we know this is a crisis for people having access to housing, the devastating effets are clear -- IMAGE OF TENT CITY NEAR AN URBAN CENTER
but how is this going to effect the larger system.


How does that financialization affect ownership , and how does it affect urban productivity?
THIS IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE WHILE THERE IS ALL THIS VALUE CREATED IN CITIES. - # FOR HOW MUCH, PLOT OF HOW IT'S INCREASED - AND QUOTE FROM WEST -- WE LACK IN ECONOMIC THEORY TO UNDERSTAND THE DISTIRBUTIONAL implications OF THIT.


WE develop the theoretical foundations for understanding the distributional effect of these things. Specifically by looking at the effects of financialization of housing in urban centers. 

Financialization capture value (of flows of surplus). It is achieved through the creation of financial instruments that allow the capture of the surplus value. 

The housing market is increasingly financialized and this thesis is about what are the effects are. 

We’re going to start by going through the key ideas that form the theoretical foundation of this thesis.


To do this we’re going to start by going through the theoretical basis for understanding these things
1. financialization
2. spatial rents
3. growth
4. and linkages between finacialization and productivity.
 
 2 then I'm going to describe how we've brought these things together in the actual model/how the model functions/and the detailed model.
 3 Then I'm going to talk about the results that we got from the model in particular around these key questions of ownership distribution and urban productivity, explore the effect of six policy experiments in the model. 
 4 Finally I'll talk about future work and conclude.

1. financialization, what financialization is  specifically  and  the specifics of what financialization looks like in the housing market.

2. spatial rents: what is - distance to city, to understand the value at the center of the city - how proximity is related, spatial rents - We'll go into classical economics to look at rent theory which illuminates the value/how spatial relationships are translated into value. Which make a key relationship between space and economics because econ is about money and productivity and space is .. here once you add transportation cost in, it gives you this connected between how far things are away and what it costs, rents are the key link between how far things are away from the center and the economic questions about productivity  that we're going to talk about

3. Then we'll talk about more commonly used economic models for productivity
rent will make the connection with the spatial. 
these are models of productivity-- making this connection between space and economics so we need these two things.
when you leave the rent they leave the spatial
Well use these elements from marginalism

 ways to understand space: because what we’re doing is bringing together ways of modelling economically. and ways of modelling spatial to understand the relationship between financialization and urbanization **
then we'll go back into spatial to see how rents were developed into urban theory, which is farther from economics but still has important additions for the spatial element. 
Space chapter takes up urban rents and develops them through urban theory in ways that .. talk about how rents were developed further in urban theory.
Financialization
Urban rents

4. tools to understand productivity and ways to understand space. but this bring pre-existing approaches together to understand this specific question I've introduced.


Then we'll go into theories of growth because productivity scale with productivity growth in cities, so we'll look at agglomeration effects which are key feature of the model- introduce that and why it's important

5. Finally  we'll add a finally little piece before we get  into the model,  which is about the relationship between the financialiation of housing and productivity

So the base model gives us the first oof our questions which is the ownership piece, then we're going to be adding an extension which allows us to ask how it affects productivity

to do that we need this piece about how the fin of housing which is the transfer of value into financial actors, is affecting productivity, so we'll lay out some possible channels through which that effect may be happening.

Then  after introducing the theoretical background, 
1. then I'll describe how we've brought these things together in an agent based model, and how the model functions. 
2. Then I'll talk about the results that we got from the model, in particular around these key questions of ownership, distribution, and urban productivity.  (The results we get  are around ownership. then we have the extension result around productivity) 
3. With and without the productivity link, we'll discuss the results of modelling 6 policy interventions. 
4. Finally I'll talk briefly about future work and conclude. 

FINANCIALIZATION
I’m trying to think how to like financial in order we’re gonna talk about what financial is specifically and how it is created in. It is done accomplished in the housing market like the specifics of what financial looks like in the housing market.

RENT
And then we’ll go into classical economics to borrow this theory of urban rents, which illuminates not urban, but you know rent to look at rent theory, which illuminates the value, or how spatial how distance how spatial relationships are translated into value in ways, like which make the relationship which make a key relationship between space and economics because economics is about money and productivity and space is something where when you add transportation cost in you have it you have this urban rents give you this connection between how far things are away and how and how much it costs, so so we’ll get into that because that makes this key connection rents the key link Sent this in a few different ways, but rents are the key link between spatial between how far things are away from the centre and the economic questions about productivity that we’re gonna talk about then we’re gonna talk about space which brings in urban theory because there’s a I forget what you talk about in space I never noticed space chapter but space chapter is about about takes up urban rents and develops them through urban theory, and ways that are useful because it is relevant already so we’re talking about how urban rents were taken developed in further in urban theory and then we’re gonna go back into But you already talked about in you talked about marginal marginal that’s in the wrench chapter

GROWTH
Just wanna put in the right order that you have it OK so before you say, bring the urban theory and you would say you would say then we’re gonna talk about more commonly used economic models to for productivity, which are important, so rents gonna make the connection with the spatial and but these are our models of productivity that are relevant because we’re again I think the key thing you’re gonna keep hitting because it’s a verbal presentation is we’re making this connection between space and economics And so we need these things so the economic things kind of when you move out of the rent they lose track of they they leave behind the spatial and we’re gonna but we’re gonna use some of these elements from marginal so we’ll introduce that then we’re gonna go back into the spatial and see how urban rents were developed into urban theory, which is less about the economics, but still has important additions for the spatial element

Should be all fairly fast, and then we’ll go into theories of growth, because population productivity skills because there’s a very important element with which productivity scales with population growth so we’re gonna look at agglomour ation effects which are going to be a key element of the model so we’re gonna look at the theory of that and it’s important and then we’re gonna add a final little little piece before we get into the model which is about the relationship between finalization of the housing market and productivity. So the base model that we’re talking about is really about gives us the first of our questions which is the ownership piece and then we’re going to be adding an extension which allows us to look at how it affects productivity and in order to do that we need this piece about what are the channels by which financial ation of the housing project house the housing market which is the transfer of value into the hands of financial actors is affecting productivity and we’re gonna talk about channels through that so we’re gonna lay out some possible channels through which that connection or that affect might be happening and then we’re gonna go into the model and The model is an agent based model something something I don’t know say some details about the model and the results we get are around ownership, and then we have the extension results around this which will take you through when we get to that point and then I’ll talk a little bit very briefly about future worker you can leave that out of the defence

RENT
Now you’re gonna need a slide that says classical rent
This is what I think you wanna say by class so classical economics developed during during the colonial. Moving into industrialization was concerned with distribution. Economies were still largely based on the feudal model with landowners, owning the land and farmers working.
OK so all that matters here is that the structure of the economy in Europe, which they were looking at was based on landowners, owning land and farmers working the land and then they would sell the product that’s what’s key to this red concept this was also developed in the context of increasing a quality as colonialism brought in flows of wealth so there was a Ricardo was writing in the context of a still largely feudal structure with colonialism shifting equality, so there was this increasing focus on inequality, but the system he was looking at was not quite yet it was soon to be transformed, but not quite yet transformed by industrialization
Classical rent theory was developed by Ricardo to talk about the value of the land, which was extracted by these landowners, so at the time landowners were paid to work the land or something so at the time landowners would own the value of the land, and the value of the land was set according to how far it was from the centre so rent theory was about how then you can just take like a description I think you’re fairly succinct we just fill in the description so basically fill in the description very precisely here of land value being like, and it’s based on the story of the car and the car has to transport at the marginal you have the extensive margin and whatever the intensive margin just fill in these things OK


Then you go after filling in the details of the carter or whatever whatever you say what this tells us is that the value of the land is related to its closeness so this gives us a spatial relationship to city centre that we can use when we’re thinking about economics in an urban context and that’s really really important to what we’re doing here, right
Later economics developed as as the economies change, and land wasn’t the main thing because we shifted from feudalism structuring to industrialization and ultimately capitalism

So we want to say that the feature of capitalism is that land is no longer the main the basis of a wealth inequality in an in such an extreme way, and it’s no longer the basis of what because if you’re not working the land you’re putting what you’re doing instead as you’re putting into production, so the economic model changes with industrialization to capitalism, because where you get these great returns are when you put the capital into production and then you’re making these things
And what that means is that the economic theory from this point shifts from having that spatial element to focussing on production with space excluded
And so at this time, what you get our models of production, which are also very important to how we’re understanding production in the cities in the model that we’re doing so you get marginal ism now you explain marginal ism, and it’s about whatever the marginal production and it has certain advantages as well because it the calculus allows you to create these very Elegant understandings of whatever whatever, and you get and equilibrium, which is important because it allows you to understand certain things about the relationships and how they find equilibrium whatever you wanna say about equilibrium sure you can figure this in so but basically the Keypointe here are it’s giving us the calculus allowed for certain things which also you might want to say didn’t have computers so they could do fairly sophisticated modelling without the capacity to do agent base modelling at this time They could also understand certain things about how production was functioning, and how value like the marginal value allowed certain certain insights, which is important and important to understanding production as opposed to land.

SPACE
Of course, in cities, even though production in itself, is not so fundamentally spatial as landownership and working the land, and then bringing the land to the city centre those have these fundamentally faced spatial things built into the structure of the economy. Space doesn’t go away and you have this alternate tradition in urban theory that has developed out of some of the insights from Ren theory but without focussing so much on economics and that’s where we have these models the Alonzo model we have Jane Jacobs and here are you feeling? What are they doing And they develop their own tradition that allows you to understand cities and space use and how cities are growing and that’s really important because again what we’re doing is bringing together the economics, and the spatial in a way that allows us to understand the financialization of the housing market, ie the economic effects within a spatial system

GROWTH
And there’s an additional piece that’s really important how cities grow and are functioning in terms economically, which is about how they grow and this is why we bring in agglomerulation effects to the model because what we see is that city scale with population city productivity scales in cities with population super linearly right this is something that has become a key stylized fact in economics whatever you wanna say.

You add in some any extra things about growth you wanna add here like how has Ben looked at? This has been looked at this way and this is where we’re drawing from like maybea little bit of the moth like fairly simple but like the key salient pieces about growth.

PRODUCTIVITY LINKAGE
And then you say, finally before we go into the model, There’s one last piece to introduce so far everything that we’ve talked about has been very important to the base model …  building this relationship between tween models of economic productivity and space these go into the base model in a way that allows us to look at how financial is ation. The capture of value within the housing market is going to affect ownership patterns because it Hass to do with how expensive it is to live near the core of the city i.e. spatial rents but we’re doing that with this model that has equilibrium in it as well and on urban theory whatever but then when we want to approach the question, how do these things affect productivity i.e. feedback into productivity in the city or feed into productivity in the city? We have this additional thing because that’s not part of this initial system, so we’ve build an extension onto the model, which will describe soon or I’ll describe soon but to do that they we have to understand that there sum possible various possible channels in which financial ation and the shift ownership and the shift from owners to tenants might affect urban productivity so we identify a few or these number of possible channels, which include list the channels the potential channels which we can explore through the extension to the model



MODEL
This is what we built 
- an agent based model
- map of features
- the details

RESULTS
OK so with this model we looked at first of all our first hypothesis which is that financialization would affect ownership and here’s the results we got around ownership.

And then results we got with the productivity linkage included.

FUTURE WORK
And then we get to the park you really want to talk about which is future work and you can say so this model has these things these basic results it can be used for policy it can be used for these things here some questions you could look at and there’s a number of extensions both to things that like you extend the model or you do this and then you go through the thing, right

- research agenda most excited about
- potential for connecting with other models - explicit firm behaviour - axtel,  transportation, development/city typology
- plumbing to get there - data, sensitivity analysis - enriched agent assumptions. -- 





CONCLUSION

WHAT WE DID

So what we've done is reviewed the theoretical foundation for this work, described the  model and results, with and without the productivity linkages, and with six policy interventions, and then discussed the implications and where this work leads.

So to conclude, what we’ve presented is fundamentally a contribution to bringing space and economic, modelling back together with with new tools. 

If you look at classical economics, space was built in because of the structure of the pre-industrial agricultural economy, but space is always part of the economy and part of what we’re saying is that space really matters, and that this is helpful for understanding the housing crisis. It’s also helpful for understanding cities and how economies of cities work because they are cities are spatial entities. If we understand finance and urban production as spaceless, then we’re missing something key that helps us to understand 1. the distribution of ownership and thus of wealth and 2. urban productivity itself. So bringing together the space and ownership with a model of urban production allows us to understand the structural effects of financialization in housing a deeper way. 

And it also allows us to explore policy questions that otherwise we would miss.  

How cities thrive is fundamentally a question of how they are structured specially because cities are spatial units, so if you wanna understand how they thrive, you have to understand the spatial structure of both how they produce and how they distribute value. If we bring those elements together, then we can under then we can approach this question in a more sophisticated, and possibly more accurate way, which can ultimately inform better policy, as well as better academic understanding.
