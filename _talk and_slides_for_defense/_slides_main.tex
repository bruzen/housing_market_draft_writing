\note[]{
    Here’s the equation that’s been estimated in the scaling literature. As long as that beta is greater than one, the productivity gets bigger as the population increases.
    
    This says that bringing people together raises everyone’s productivity. It says there are increasing returns to urban labour. There are no firms in this formulation
    
    Growth theorists addressed this using a formulation for the firm that’s become pretty standard: the Cobb-Douglas production function.
    
    This has diminishing returns at the firm level. According to the theory the wage is the VMPL, so we a theoretically consistent way to derive the wage
    
    We can show the two equations are nested in the following of the same model.
    
    We make the productivity term depend on urban population. If population rises, wages rise.
    
    This is now a linked firm-city model of production with DRS for the firm and IRS for the City

\note[enumerate]{\item This first equation is just the marginal productivity of workers. It is the derivative of equation 2 with respect to $n$.To maximize profits firms should follow this rule. I assume they do.
\item The second equation just identifies the part of the wage the firm pays that is above the rural wage. In the Alonso model it attracts people to the city
\item The third is a simple calculation of area for a \textbf{city grid}. Agents at the edge of the city decide to work or not, so this is an approximation at any point in time.

\note[enumerate]{\item Let's compare the result if there is feedback to productivity
\item Now the real variables are affected
\item With a 100\% tax the real economy follows the no spillover path a 100\% tax \textbf{insulates the economy} against the feedback.
\item We see rising tenantization reducing productivity, which pulls down the wage, which reduces city size.
\item With no capital gains tax on housing speculation, the economy crashes
\item complete financialization of the housing stock happens faster. 
\item With a 50\% rate financialization of the housing stock is slower. This is interesting. The slower growth reduces capital gains and makes speculation  less  profitable

\item  The cost of capital has surprisingly little effect on any variables in either case

\item  Transportation cost has a strong effect on wages and city size as expected 
 
\item Low transportation costs with financial system spillovers appear to induce something like cyclical behaviour

\begin{frame}{Final comments}
 \begin{itemize} \Large
\item There is a gap in economic theory around who gets urban rents and why that matters.
\item I partly bridge this gap by combining from several  fields:

    \begin{enumerate}\item Jacobs agglomeration
    
    \item The scale literature 
    
    \item Neoclassical growth theory
    
    \item Neoclassical production theories
    
    \item Alonso-style urban analysis
    
    \item Ricardian rent theory
    \end{enumerate}
\end{itemize}

\item The model is modular and extensible
\item It allows us to explore a variety of policy interventions 
\item It tells us that: 
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Financial interests are likely to take over much of the land and capture much of the surplus generated by the city
    \item The capture of urban value by financial actors affects the social class and may affect urban productivity
    \item Public policies will have different effects if financialization affects productivity
    \end{enumerate}
