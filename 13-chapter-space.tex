% \section{Intro 2}
The discussion of rent in the previous chapter provides the necessary economic logic that underlies the analysis in this thesis, but we are interested in the application of rent theory to the modern urban economy. For that, we draw on relatively recent models from urban economics and urban geography. Economic geography in general is the use of the tools of economics to analyze locational decisions. Applied to urban areas, it takes up urban issues such as crime, education, public transit, housing, land use restrictions, local labor markets, agglomeration economies, trade, transportation infrastructure, and local government finance. 

The early 1960s marked a watershed for the field.  Alonso (1964), Mills (1967) and Muth (1969) introduced a theory of the internal structure of a city that explains land values in terms of transportation costs. The goal of this chapter is to describe informally the now classic and dominant spatial urban model that that emerged at that time. 

This new model of urban structure linked the urban wage premium to urban land rents through transportation costs.  It rapidly became the workhorse for theorists and empirical researchers. It helped explain land prices, the built form of the city, and where people live relative to where they work using a logic analogous to Ricardo's theory of rent. Where Ricardo explained land rent in terms of cost of transportation to market (***E CHECK THIS) through the story of the carter carrying farm products to market in Section~\ref{section-rent-carter}), this new model applied a similar logic to explain location value in terms of how much ***E people?? workers? renters?? will pay to be close the the city centre within a city where workers commute to jobs. 

It serves in our analysis as the link between rent theory and financialization. % we will use. 
In this chapter, we will review the theory and development of the core urban model and discuss how it uses urban land rent to explain urban size and structure. % to our analysis. These models (From: Handbook of Regional and Urban Economics, 2004) 

***E NEW SECTION?? : DEVELOPMENT? 

***E ADD SOMETHING LIKE This basic urban model model is built around the \gls{bid-rent curve} that allows us to calculate how much renters will pay as a function of distance from city cetnre. The seeds of this curve  that is at the heart of the model were presented as early as 1885  by German engineer-economist Wilhelm Launhardt \cite{blaugEconomicTheoryRetrospect1985, launhardtMathematischeBegruendungVolkswirthschaftslehre1885}. The  \gls{bid-rent function} was first applied explicitly to the equilibrium of land use patterns in agricultural production by August Losch \cite{loschEconomicsLocation1954} in Germany and later by Edgar S. Dunn \cite{dunnEquilibriumLandUsePatterns1954} in America. It was not until the 1960s that it was discovered that it could be applied  to the urban setting by Alonso and others. 
This basic model is often called the Alonso model, although it  was developed by several scholars working in parallel in parallel in roughly the same period. William Alonso published \textit{Location and Land Use} in 1964  \cite{alonsoLocationLandUse1964} based on his 1960 PhD thesis \cite{alonsoModelUrbanLand1960},  
giving him a slender priority in the literature. 
Richard Muth's \cite{muthSpatialStructureHousing1961}, and \cite{muthRationalExpectationsTheory1961} were written roughly simultaneously with and independently of Alonso's thesis, and culminated in Muth's classic book, Cities and Housing  \cite{muthCitiesHousingSpatial1969}.\footnote{See ``William Alonso, Richard Muth, Resources for  the Future, and the founding of urban economics''\cite{mcdonaldWilliamAlonsoRichard2007} for a more detailed discussion of the development of the model.}  % ***E ADD % This workoverlps with Alonso in these ways. Differed in these ways \dots USE THIS TO FLESH OUT MORE OF THWAT HIS MODEL?WORK ISDOING AND HOW
% We will refer to the core urban model developed by 
 The model was developed further by Muth \cite{muthCitiesHousingSpatial1969} and Mills \cite{millsAggregativeModelResource1967}, and later formalised by Wheaton \cite{wheatonComparativeStaticAnalysis1974}.\footnote{it is also called the Alonso model, the Alonso-Muth model, the Alonso-Muth-Mills model, the circular city model, and the monocentric city model.} %(***E ADD \dots % He was concerned with \dots His model did \dots INTRODUCE THE WORK ITSELF) 
\footnote{It is worth noting that Lowdon Wingo also had what appears to be a working paper, \textit{Transportation and Urban Land} \cite{wingoTransportationUrbanLand1961}, for the organization Resources for the Future  in preparation for publication that presented a core idea and  significantly influenced Muth \cite{mcdonaldWilliamAlonsoRichard2007}.} Mills' \textit{Urban Economics} \cite{millsUrbanEconomics1972}. followed soon after. 

It was then very quickly recognized as a fraternal twin of August von Th\"unern's 1826 agricultural planning model \cite{vonthunenIsolirteStaatBeziehung1826}. von Th\"unern actually wrote down a version of Equation~\ref{eqn-bid-rent}. With the work of Alonso and his contemporaries, the classical concept of land rent  moved  from  agricultural economics to the centre of the modern urban economy.  

 Bruckner \cite{bruecknerStructureUrbanEquilibria1987} describes the resulting model as ``a simple yet powerful model of urban spatial structure that successfully explains the principal regularities observed in the urban landscape,'' and goes on to say ``the good predictive performance of the model suggests that its simplifications are artfully chosen, capturing the essential features of real-world cities.'' It remains the central model in modern urban economics.




\section{From Ricardo's rent to Alonso's urban model}

Alonso's model re-presents Ricardo's conception of rent mathematically for a different social system and production technology. Ricardo had described a model with a central market for an agricultural product like potatoes. Producing potatoes took land and transporting potatoes to market was costly. Because there is one market price for potatoes, land with low transportation costs near the central market earns a rent. More distant land has lower value for farmers. In Alonso's model there is central market and a single price for labour, producing labour takes land, and transporting labour to the market is costly. Rent emerges from the scarcity of space close to the labour market at the city core, just as  in Ricardo it emerges from the scarcity of land near the market for potatoes and grains. 

The model is built around an extremely simple trick for calculating what people will bid or pay to live at a particular location  called the \gls{bid-rent curve}. That amount is a locational rent of the sort Ricardo discussed in the context of an agricultural economy.  

***E ESTABLISH BASIC PRINCIPLES/CONTEXT. The model is of a city with SUCH AND SUCH FEATURES. More jobs at the centre of the city only so much housing. commuting costs go up as you get further away. It assumes that workers are more productive in city centres where there are more jobs ??? Other reasons ??? However there is more demand to live at the city centre. MAny workers will have to commute.

Starting with the fact that a worker is more productive in the city, the worker should receive a wage premium, $\omega$, for working in the city. That premium has to cover the cost of commuting to work, so the amount of the  wage premium left as a benefit for the urban worker must decline with distance from the workplace. 

But notice this additional point: if workers are renting their homes, landlords can charge a premium for being closer to the center of the city where transportation costs are lower.  What this essentially means is that landlords can capture a share of urban productivity. ***E CAN YOU RESTATE THIS TO MAKE SURE IT"S UNDERSTOOD. LIKE: That is, landlords are able to capture a share of the extra value produced at the centre of a city ***E PLEASE EDIT

The bid rent curve offers a way to answer the question of how much  landlords can charge by answering how much  a worker will bid for a rental as determined by ***E CHECK... the wage premium?? and the transportation costs.  The maximum charge is the part of the wage premium left after transportation costs are paid. If landlords are at all ***E CHANGE WORD? greedy, that is also the minimum they will charge. ***E I don't understand this. how can the maximum be the minimum???? Why would workers pay more than the maximum. Doesn't that defy the logic of the model??? I believe you that it happens but please explain. You may also want to move this down to after explaining the model in basic terms. 

We can write a very simple formula for the surplus  value at any point $d$ from the centre of the city. This value is called the bid-rent  $mathcal{R}$: 
\begin{equation}  
\mathcal{R}= \omega - dc \label{eqn-bid-rent}\end{equation}
where $d$ is the distance from work and $c$ is the transportation costs.\footnote{ if the wage is paid monthly then $c$ has to be the monthly transportation cost.} Equation~\ref{eqn-bid-rent} describes a downward-sloping line (a curve) that is known as the bid-rent curve. 

 The \gls{bid-rent curve} is the key to the Alonso model.\footnote{We are describing the simplest possible version of the model. There are many excellent versions that incorporate complex spatial geography, multiple spillover effects, and other features-- see for example \cite{ahlfeldtECONOMICSDENSITYEVIDENCE2015} for an example and extensive references---, but our focus is on the effects of financialization, so we use the minimal model to bring out effects that would be more difficult to disentangle in a more complex model. Qualitative results should be unaffected by this simplification.}  It represents a special  kind of economic equilibrium:   a locational equilibrium among mobile households. Since individuals would simply move to any location that offered a higher utility, in an equilibrium all the otherwise identical workers must receive the same utility. This has to be the case even though those farther from the center must pay more for transportation to and from home. The variable that  adjusts to maintain equal utility with rising transportation spendig is the cost of housing. This conception of a \gls{locational equilibrium} is what underlies the bid-rent curve and all its extensions.\footnote{For economists it is also described as a Nash equilibrium.}

% The Alonso model extends the approach developed in Ricardo approach to rent to the urban system, and is % Alonso's spatial model is 
% rooted in the classical notion of rent. 



The new urban models ***E OR ALONSOS model? I FEEL LIKE YOU NEED TO PICK A NAME??? ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT MULTIPLE MODELS?? MODELS IS PLURAL. a MISTAKE OR NO? exploit the relationship between rent and location  described in  Equation~\ref{eqn-bid-rent} to explore the spatial structure of the city. Figure~\ref{fig-alonso-simple} illustrates the simplest case. We are looking at a thin slice of the city from the centre to its edge at $d^*$. The vertical dimension is dollars of rent or transportation cost.  Notice that rent and transportation cost sum to $\omega$. 

We assume in this simple model that the city sits on a uniform plane and has a population of identical workers with identical housing needs, and identical transportation costs who all work at the city centre and receive the same wage. We also assume, as is common for simple versions of the model, that the labour market and production sector at the centre take no space. 

As above, transportation to and from the center costs ${c}$ times the distance $d$ from the center.\footnote{Fuel, capital, and time costs are  all included in the transportation costs, ${c}$. } The diagonal line is the bid-rent curve. The figure shows  bid-rent declining with distance from the centre and transportation cost rising. Property values at any point are a multiple of the rent at that point.\footnote{In this model they are simply the capitalized (present discounted) value of the stream of rent. Amenities, taxes and building values all modify the value calculation in more realistic cases.} At $d^*$ transportation costs completely absorb the wage premium. There is no surplus that the landlord can extract.\footnote{In many discussions of the model it is assumed that beyond $d^*$ the best use of the land is for agriculture since it cannot earn a rent premium. }

In Figure~\ref{fig-alonso-simple}, the height of yellow triangle $\omega$ represents the wage premium $\omega$ for urban labour and the amount land rent earned at the centre % of the city.  at the centre, 
where transportation costs are zero. The entire yellow triangle is aggregate land rent generated by the city along a section from the centre to the edge. 
The model says nothing about who gets the rent in the urban economy. 
For classical economists it was obvious that the agricultural rents went to the class of land-owners, as discussed in Chapter~\ref{chapter-rent}. 
For us it is a question to examine, since it depends on who owns the land, ***E MAYBE ADD: and land ownership is no longer (explicitly??) restricted to any particular class of individuals **.  Transportation cost depends on the distance  to and from the center.  
The gray triangle represents the aggregate transportation expenditure by residents along a section from the centre to the edge. 
The entire rectangle, $\omega$ $\times$ $d^*$, is the wage bill generated by urban agglomeration for the workers on the strip of land illustrated. Urban land rent is the residual when transport costs are deducted from the wage premium. %It declines with distance $d$ until, at the edge of the city, $d^*$, the cost of transportation consumes the entire wage ($d^*{c}=\omega$, where ${c}$ is the transportation cost, including fuel, capital, and time costs. The grey triangle represents the amount of the surplus dissipated in travel costs.  Property values are simply the present discounted value of the rent at any point.

At the bottom of the figure we add a `subsistence wage'  earned by a worker whether in the city or outside of the city. In most analyses of urban spaces, this living wage is simply ignored, since it is the wage premium that generates rents.  The relative size is unimportant because it is the same for urban and non-urban workers. If urban consumption is higher than non-urban consumption it must come out of the land rent.
% Workers are attracted to the city by the wage premium, $\omega$,  which represents the share of the surplus generated by the city that goes to labour.  

% The extent  of the city  $d^*$ is  simply the distance at which total $rt$ transportation cost  is equal to the wage premium
% \[d^*{c}= \omega\]
% where ${c}$ is the unit cost of transportation. In the figure, $-{c}$ is the slope of the diagonal line dividing rent from transportation expenditure.

 \subsection{The magnitude of rents and transportation costs}
 From $\omega$, $c$ and population density we can derive population, wage bill, total rent, and transportation costs. The figure above suggests that  half of the urban surplus is spent on transportation, but that is because the figure makes it appear that the city is stretched out in one dimension. If  the city is circular, the total value of rents can be represented as  a cone with radius $d^*$, height $\omega$ and volume  \[ V=\frac{1}{3}\pi  d^{*2} \omega \]
Since $d^*=\omega/c$ we can substitute out either  $\omega$ or  $d^*$ to show that total rent is  proportional to the cube of either  $d^*$ or $\omega$. 

The total value of wage payments appears as the volume of the cylinder enclosing the cone since the wage is the same for each unit of labour no matter where it resides: 
$V=\pi r^2 \omega$. This is generally a fraction of the value of the city's agglomeration economies. 
Total transport costs are $\frac{2}{3}\pi  d^{*2} \omega).$
With uniform density, the population is proportional to the square of  $d^{*2}$ while rents and transportation costs are proportional to the cube. %move this?

% ADD -DEFINITION OF bid-rent, 

 
\subsection{Limitations of the basic model}
% Net land rent} 
The simple graphical model we consider above is revealing, but it leaves out many important features of the urban system. For one thing, the only costs included are the transportation costs for the individual.  Since urban services and  a substantial fraction of urban amenities are financed through the public sector a more complete model must include both servicing costs and property taxation. The relevant rent profile from an economic point of view is net of all service costs. From a financial point of view, it is net of tax liabilities.% It would be interesting to produce a 3-D graph of the NET rents. FIGURE

It's also worht noting that, since the Alonso model is  a model of competitive real estate markets, its utility might vary substantially depending on the competitiveness of the market.  In less than competitive markets, other factors may affect bid-rents significantly. % Figure showing variations and modern adaptations of the model.
Gao et al. \cite{GaoJinlong2020BtbT}, for example,  found  that for China, ``other exogenous  factors---including the distinct land system  and centralized political institutions---also matter a great deal.'' In general, however, 
research has largely supported the bid-rent model (\cite{mutoEstimationBidRent2006, wheatonBidRentApproach1977}) Muto \cite{mutoEstimationBidRent2006}, for example concluded that,  ``land usage on average follows the rule that is consistent with the bid-rent function model: whichever usage outbids the others occupies the land. ''  Borba and Dentinhoand concluded that ``The method has proved its usefulness and effectiveness for predicting the impacts of exogenous shocks in complex urban systems'' \cite{borbaEvaluationUrbanScenarios2016}.  

In a test for the city of Bogota, Gross \cite{grossEstimatingWillingnessPay1988} found that ``the bid-rent model works reasonably well in its predictions and in its estimates of the demand for attributes and, in some ways, it may perform better than a hedonic-type model in forecasting the demand for housing attributes.'' 

Clay and Valdez incorporate bid-rent model into an integrated ABM transportation-land use mode that achieves levels of accuracy similar to the best models currently available. These are the microsimulation of UrbanSim;\footnote{UrbanSim is a micrcosimulation land use model, designed to support the need of Metropolitan Planning Organizations (MPOs), cities and other organizations for analyzing the potential effects of land use policies and infrastructure investments on the development and character of cities and regions. The core model code has been developed in the Python programming language as Open Source software and is publicly available on the Urban Data Science Toolkit GitHub page \cite{waddellmodellinurbandev2002}} and the bid-rent sub-module of \footnote{PECAS is  HBA Specto Incorporated's commercial modelling system  for simulating spatial economic systems.} developed by Abraham and Hunt (2005), the best models currently available. They emphasise the advantage of ABM model is allowing for agents to differ in composition and in preferences making them unique bidders. 
% Agents must compute the maximum bid price they are willing to pay.
An earlier analysis by Curran and Carlson \cite{curranTheoryResidentialLocation1982}, among other, extended the bid-rent model include two-worker households and a secondary employment location. They showed that households would be expected to segregate spatially, but the pattern will depend on the specific combination of wages, transport costs and the mix of household types in the populations. 

% \section{Implications of Alonso's urban model}
Even with all its simplifications, the model can describe many features of urban structure and urban history. In this section, we illustrate some of the insights supported by the model. Extensions can incorporate variations in wages, density, transportation costs, preference, and even building technology and codes. The limitations of the simple, continuous, equilibrium-based versions described above can be overcome using agent-based models to model the evolution of complex and much more realistic urban systems. 


***E ADDED FROM ABOVE:
The models *E PLURAL??? don't however bring forward the distributional and class features derived by the classical economists. They don't examine distribution or how the distribution of rents might affect the productivity of the city, which means they throw no light on the effects of financialization of the property market on distribution or on urban productivity. *** E ADD:  This is the limitation we seek to address in this thesis as we explore who gets the urban land rents and how that is changed by the financialization of urban housing.

\section{Summary}
In this chapter we have described a very stylized models to  establish how the urban system generates rents. % and relating them to neoclassical growth theory.  
% This chapter introduces the background to the theory of the urban model. 
This is important because we will essentially build that standard urban model into our model of financialization and in the process we will be adding to the standard urban model the distributional consequences that have been overlooked, by carrying the concept of rent through to explore the distributional consequences and how the distribution of rents feeds back into the productivity of cities. 

% Our base model builds on this basic classic urban Alonso model, so it will capture core features with a simple established framework to connect with the existing literature.  One feature of this model is that none of the simplifying assumptions are essential. We maintain the basic simplicity, but the mode can easily be generalized in many ways, and there is a substantial body of work extending and varying each of the simplifications in the model, as discussed above, as well as substantial work grounding and testing the model empirically.
