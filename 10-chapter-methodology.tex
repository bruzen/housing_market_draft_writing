\chapter{Methodology} \label{chapter-methodology}

In this chapter we discuss the methodological approach of the thesis, as well as a number of modelling decisions. We develop a model of a complex, dynamical, multi-agent economic system, drawing on techniques and insights from several fields. In doing so we are attentive to the strengths and weaknesses of the approaches that we are adopting. 

We are focused on the evolution of a city. Cities evolve continuously and may never be in  equilibrium. At best the numerous people and organizations in the city are adjusting individually in sensible ways to the changing parameters of the city they inhabit. The system is complex because there are many agents making unsynchonized, individual decisions independently. %One natural  way to explore such a systeme tool urban processes this sort is analogous to the way 
Agent-Based Models (ABMs) mimic this view of the city.   

%Our main simulation tool is an ABM. 
In an ABM Agents are defined as having adjustment rules or behaviours that respond to environmental variables.\footnote{This approach is not unfamiliar to economists - The Cournot duopoly model, for example,  is analyzed using  `reaction functions' which simply describe a firm's optimal response to as second firm's output choice.} Agent based models commit to computational methods from the beginning.  A program is written that considers each agent sequentially and updates agent and system statuses as it goes. The program  is  allowed to iterate, and the values of any state variables of interest are recorded at each step. The model may or may not settle into a  steady state. As with any computational model, we can  explore the behaviour of the system by varying parameters, and  can explore the parameter space using Monte Carlo methods.

In Economic modelling, on the other hand, the most familiar approach is the  analysis of systems in equilibrium. A set of necessary conditions describing a steady state of interest are imposed and then solved to find features of the equilibrium they generate.  It is a highly productive methodology partly because it conveniently  bypasses the complex process of adjustment by focusing on the conditions that must be true if a particular situation is to persist.

The classic example is the ubiquitous supply and demand model. Each of the curves represents the plausible behaviours of a class of agents. A  situation is not likely to persist if either of the classes of agents is not satisfied with the combination of price and quantity. The conclusion   is that the only combinations that can persist for long are  those that satisfy the behavoural intentions of both classes - i.e., are on both curves. If the two curves can be described mathematically, equilibrium prices and quantities can be derived solving the two-equation system.

The approach produces tractable  models that can often be solved explicitly. To achieve tractability, it is often convenient, even necessary, to limit the number of independent decision-makers by employing a ``representative agent.'' To extend the analysis to dynamic systems, ``laws of motion'' (adjustment rules)  can be added in the form of either difference or differential equations.   Models become intractable very quickly when there are more agents or dynamic processes, and economists, like physicists and weather forecasters, resort to simulation techniques  and numerical methods.

The problem of model complexity remains a challenge with ABMs, however, and we introduce simplifying assumptions. These are not as a rule needed for the computational model but are very helpful in maintaining a focus on the key theme  of the thesis. For example, we draw heavily on economic analysis of cities, and employ three key economic equilibrium conditions drawn from the economic literature. 

%Some adjustments are slow and some are fast. Rates of adjustment can matter. 

Because our focus is financialization in the land market, we use  the equilibrium conditions for competitive labour markets, to bypass the complex and partially understood wage-setting process. We simply assume a core theoretical result from the theory of the firm, that workers are paid their marginal value-product. We ground this device in recent research that has shown that, in essence, derived and estimated an aggregate urban production function consistent with modern neoclassical growth theory.\footnote{we are not aware of other research that has taken this step yet.} We use the result to derive an urban wage premium that drives city growth. We would argue that, since labour markets can adjust more quickly than land markets, we can assume that their adjustment is occurring continuously in the background.  

A similar market-based argument allows us to assume that land rents are determined by the classic urban locational equilibrium. The theory is based on the insight that if individual utilities are higher at one location in the city, entrants or movers will choose that  location. This is an implication of simple consumer choice theory. In a market with any degree of churn market prices for land should converge fairly quickly on the use values, and these will vary systematically with transportation costs. We present the model for the case where individuals are identical and have identical transportation costs. In the computational model we can introduce site-specific and person-specific features. 

Finally, we employ equilibrium reasoning  in the housing and investment process. We assume investors behave rationally, calculating an offer price in each transaction based land rents and expected price changes, the individual price of capital, individual discount rates and availability of  information. It is at this point we introduce an innovation to formal urban modelling.   We draw on the literature for the relevant `stylized facts' about differences in these values based on wealth and income. This opens the possibility of urban segregation and the endogenous emergence of class distinction based on capital access, a process explored by John Roemer in his neglected General Theory of Exploitation and Class.  

Expectations have to take into account some amount of current and past information. Forecasts based on recent price movements can give rise to price bubbles through either speculative or precautionary motives. Expectations anchored in perfect foresight have different dynamics. We employ backwards-looking expectation formation anchored to current rental returns. We derive an investment rule of this sort in Chapter~\ref{chapter-financialization}.

The Agent Base Modelling approach is 

For example, from the Alonzo model we impose the locational equilibrium condition,
\[U_i(d,\dots)=U_j(d, /dots)\]
This says that identical individuals must get the same utility living at at whatever distance from the city centre. If that were not the case, individuals would move to a location where they get higher utility.

different location would take a long time to work through the system. Prices, however, can adjust much more quickly. 

 It follows that 
\[\frac{\partial U_i(d, d(dots)}{\partial t}=\frac{\partial U_j(d, /dots)}{\partial t}\]
With identical transportation cost, 
land rents are determined by transportation costs  and  

We use  equilibrium arguments in our model to describe hiring decisions by producers and wage demands by workers. Equilibrium locational by commuters determines the extent and even population of the city. They also determine the pattern of land rents.

First they've not tended to build in, in a sophisticated way classical economic theory,
In general, classical economic theory has not been developed in agent based modeling work
Agent based models have begun with simple models, using and relaxing neoclassical assumptions, and building from first principles. This is absolutely the place to start. As the field matures, it makes sense to introduce theory in a more nuanced way, that connects with classical theory/the history of thought, etc

Second, relatively little agent based modelling work integrates with the neoclassical economic work in a way that makes the relation clear/holds the advantages. ABM work tends to both reject neoclassical approaches and rely on neoclassical assumptions.
More generally only a few agent models (e.g. spruce budworm) connect the analytic and agent models in a clear rigorous way. We focus on holding in addition to the relation with classical theory, a close connection with the many advances made withing neoclassical modelling

- this connection will make it easier to incorporate in teaching and for mainstream economists to engage on and build with.

This work builds, first, a simple conceptually clear model tightly integrated with the core economic modelling traditions, that builds on the theory of rent.

% ALSO (Agent modelling also tents to model individuals- we also take some steps to agent based modelling beyond the individual, and to the work developing model in a mode ideas)

Third, econ lacks resilience analysis and models, yet hysteresis clearly present in the relation between the built environment and econ activity. Although there's been work on dynamics and individual effects, there has been little work looking at the resilience dynamics in economic models, we take that approach looking at the resilience of community and individual wealth, and the relationship between that wealth and productivity. 

- This puts resilience dynamics at the center of economic analysis.

The resilience analysis looks at the dynamics of rent in economic boom and bust cycles.
There is a ratchet effect, achieved through hysteresis in the system, in which sucks wealth out of communities on the way up and on the way down. % DETAIL ONCE DRAFTED.
