Cities are a central feature of human society - Human beings are increasingly an urban species. Cities are one of the primary sources of technological development and increasing wealth. Behind these observations is a fundamental feature demonstrated in the recent literature on scaling laws: the productivity of cities increases super-linearly in population. Cities are the locus of a positive feedback loop: rising populations raises productivity, rising productivity attracts more people and resource.

Cities are where people live and work, where a great deal of production is concentrated, in addition to being where wealth is created and accumulated, cities are also where income is actually distributed. 

In Canada, there is a housing crisis. In the last few years, the need for affordable housing has come into focus as one of the most pressing issues facing Canadians. As more and more Canadians are finding housing unaffordable, the effects are being seen in everything from declining home ownership rates to an increasing number of Canadians unable to afford housing at all.

It's effects push substantially into the middle class, driving vacancies, poverty, and displaces a whole class of workers.
The housing crisis raises the question of whether Canadian cities can continue to attract people and accumulate wealth for its residents and industries, whether in fact they can even sustain their growth.

There has been extensive work on the drivers of the crisis, including supply shortages, stagnating incomes, and the finacialization of housing ownership.

There has been less work on the implications for productivity. 
Yet, the economics is clear that this is what's at stake is the productivity of cities, the distributive features of the economy and the impact of the middle class % THIS IS A RESULT NOT AN INPUT. WHAT GOES HERE?

\textbf{WHY IT'S BEEN MISSING}
EXPLAIN BETTER HERE WHY SPACE HAS BEEN LEFT OUT, AND WHY THAT LET'S US NEGLECTS SPATIAL RENTS AND MISS THE RELATION BETWEEN SPACE AND PRODUCTIVITY.

We're talking about what is the puzzle? This is the teaser for this thesis and this thesis offers an answer to and I've just started to suggest that the teaser is given that we see urbanization and continuing and financialization. accelerating. Although we understand that financialization is really just capital seeking profits, where what is the source of the profit of the rents that they're capturing? And the answer is in conventional urban theory, which allows us to identify the spatial distribution of those rents and traditional rent theory, which allows us to understand the social relations of those, those rents, the classical economists spend a great deal of time on that question. And we're very clear about it.

\textbf{HOW WE ADD IT BACK IN}

Our focus is land rents, but in the context of an urban economy. 

This thesis presents a spatial model of the city that incorporates distributional issues and financialization and allows us to examine the productivity implications of the housing crisis. The model that incorporates the scaling of productivity in cities within a standard urban model. 

Our approach/model is constructed, drawing together pieces from %a number of sub-literatures from 
economics and the study of cities, including rent theory, production functions, the standard urban model, growth theory, urban growth theories, financialization and the theory of distribution.
We relate this to the scaling models from the study of complexity. This gives a deeper look at distribution in the cities, the effect of financialization, and effect of both of these on the growth and development of cities. 

The urban model is based on those developed in geography, planning and urban economics. The organizing principle in  the spatial models of all three disciplines is an economic variable, land rent, which is the link to distribution, financialization and continuing productivity. *** (another sentence on why this is great)

The analysis makes clear that in addition to the recognized distributional consequences, the housing crisis has productivity impacts that should be considered in developing urban and housing policy.

rent is key to financialization, main urban models don't observe the distribution of rents

in general, classical economic theory has not been developed in agent based modeling work

ABM work tends to both reject neoclassical approaches and rely on neoclassical assumptions.

econ lacks resilience analysis and models, yet hysteresis clearly present in the relation between the built environment and econ activity

This analysis raises the concern, implication for urban development of growing rent extraction by the financial sector.   In the context of this we position the results in the larger system, analyze the potential for a range of interventions, and suggest policy implications.

The analysis tells us that the advantages of financialized capital are robust 

In principle there are a range of alternative regimes.
The advantages of financial capital have multiple sources, so the result does not require that any one advantage be true all of the time, so it's not sensitive to small or localized changes in policy environments.

are true across a range of explanations/features - including REITS and formal financial capital, second houses purchased by the investment vehicles by the middle class, and mortgages which represents the banks' share of privately owned homes

There is also a ratchet effect, achieved through hysteresis in the system, in which sucks wealth out of communities on the way up and on the way down.

\subsection{Methodological Contributions}


Formal economic modelling, for a long time, focused on equilibrium analysis of marginal effects, and representative agents which hid distributional effects, as well as spaceless economic models of markets made it difficult to capture the richer spacial dynamics of urban rents, and the details of the ways economic forces play out for individual actors.

More recent work has looked at agent based modeling, looking at the dynamics, space and individual work. 

\textbf{We offer three developments/extensions building on that work.}

First they've not tended to build in, in a sophisticated way classical economic theory, beginning with simple models, using and relaxing neoclassical assumptions, and building from first principles. This is absolutely the place to start. As the field matures, it makes sense to introduce theory in a more nuanced way, that connects with classical theory/the history of thought, etc

Secondly, only a few agent models (e.g. spruce budworm) connect the analytic and agent models in a clear rigorous way. We focus on holding in addition to the relation with classical theory, a close connection with the many advances made withing neoclassical modelling - this connection will make it easier to incorporate in teaching and for mainstream economists to engage on and build with.


building firs ta simple conceptually clear model tightly integrated with the core economic modelling traditions, that builds on the theory of rent.

% ALSO (Agent modelling also tents to model individuals- we also take some steps to agent based modelling beyond the individual, and to the work developing model in a mode ideas)

Third, although there's been work on dynamics and individual effects, there has been little work looking at the resilience dynamics in economic models, we take that approach looking at the resilience of community and individual wealth, and the relationship between that wealth and productivity. - put resilience dynamics at the center of economic analysis.

This is important for understanding the current policy context. 

Historically low interest rates, and financial crises, have been a primary driver of rapid inflows of financial captial, accelerating the process, which raises the question of what will happen as interest rates rise. The analysis suggests however that there is hysteresis, that both the economic upswing and the downswing pull wealth out of communities, like a kind of ratchet or peristaltic pump. We analyze and model these dynamics in the resilience Chapter, Chapter \ref{chapter-resilience}



\section{Document overview}

There are three parts, Part \ref{part-background} gives the background and develops the theory for our analysis, Part \ref{part-model} develops the model and analyzes the results, and Part \ref{part-system}, puts the model and theory in the context of a larger system, using methods of systems analysis and design, then discusses the potential for interventions and policy.

Chapter \ref{chapter-background} sketches how this thesis relates to four major fields ..., and the role of space as a unifying factor across three of the fields.

In Chapter \ref{chapter-rent}, we link classical rent theory, neoclassical production theory, neoclassical growth theory, the scaling literature, and urban spatial models.

Chapter \ref{chapter-growth} is on growth. To show how our model is directly connected with this broad collection of linked theories, we use the Cobb-Douglas function, which is used across this entire range of literature 

% After we develop the mathematical description of the relationship among these will discuss  in more detail, rent theory and our contribution, scaling laws, ......  and other issues in the literature that draw on parts of this model and 

 % ???  apply to the specific situation we're in why rent theory is related to discussions of exploitation why it might lead the inefficiencies, whether or not this links with other important models in the literature.

Chapter \ref{chapter-space} is on space and the Alonzo model.

In Chapter \ref{chapter-financialization} we  provide a description of finacialization and show it is a a form of rent-seeking in the housing market and ?? the potential consequences of fiancialization in the housing market. 

In Chapter \ref{chapter-model} we  describe an illustrative agent-based model of the urban system. Most of the analysis of urban systems has employed analytical models with roots that go back to von Thunen () and more recently Alonzo. These models are extremely useful, but necessarily abstract from the concrete  and variable individual behaviour and  the details  of dynamics that make real cities path-dependent. XXX (Dawn) have shown that agent-based models can reproduce the features of the analytical models, at least in simple cases. 


% After we develop the mathematical description of the relationship among these will discuss in more detail, various relevant applications, and issues in the literature that draw on parts of this model and apply to the specific situation we're in why rent theory is related to discussions of exploitation why it might lead the inefficiencies, whether or not this links with other important models in the literature.

% Because we draw on a wide range of methods and literatures, we discuss the relevant literature and  methodologies in the chapters where they apply
