 %In a similar way, people pay a higher price for housing near  urban jobs and amenities. Land near the centre of a city provides locational services that are far more valuable than any of its potential agricultural services. Because nature did not make much land close to the city center, these locational services are scarce and command a high price. The extra cost to be close to the center is an \gls{economic rent}. 
% In general, the locational element is ignored but, IT IS ALWAYS OR GENERALLY AT PLAY?. Even in the sports example. 

In an urban economy, land provides benefits in the form of housing, and places for work, storage, commerce and recreation. Location matters in an urban economy because value is generated by bringing people and activities together. The value of a piece of land in a city derives, not from the richness of the soil, but from the richness of the activities is supports and because of the people and activities it provides access to.   

The economist's notion of rent  overlaps with, but is not identical with common usage. \Gls{rent}, in economic theory is not the amount a tenant pays a landlord every month, nor is it simply a payment for using land or another facility. Originally the term was applied to the payments landowners collected. In classical theory the concept was modified to mean payment for payment for ``the indestructible qualities of the productivity of land'' \cite{Gray1914RentUT}. The economic value of land naturally depends on its location---without  nearby buyers, the product of the land has no market value at all---so while the term rent was used to refer to the payment itself, it was actually referring to locational value of the land. %The value of land is accounted for by the economic concept of rent. 

For modern economists, the word, initially developed to understand the income of landowners, extends to include the \gls{surplus} income produced by any scarce factor of production that is created by nature. %and has locational value. 
People pay a high price for housing near the center of a city because there is a limited amount of land close to the center, and being close to urban jobs and amenities is valuable. The extra payment for being close to the center is an \gls{economic rent}. 
Land with natural resources like mineral deposits, similarly generates locational rents. 

Economists also talk about scarce talents using the concept of rent.  The natural talents of a sports star like Lionel Messi have great market value and  also generate rents, since people like Messi are very scarce. It may not be obvious to think of Messi as having a locational value, but if his services cannot be delivered to a market willing to pay to watch football, his services as a footballer have little or no economic value.% and he might do better as a housepainter.
\footnote{The market model of football has become almost an inversion of the agricultural market. Stadiums served as the market place where buyers and sellers met, but television now delivers Messi to global market, greatly expanding the rents he can bargain for.} 

In this thesis, we use the concept of rent to model how financialization allows for the capture of a growing share of urban productivity. %This concept of rent provides us with a theory for understanding the distribution of surplus. 
If financialization of the urban housing market is directed to capturing the stream of economic surpluses generated by the city, the theory of rent provides a basis for understanding the allocation of surpluses.

In this chapter, we build a bridge from \gls{classical rent theory} to the modern theory of urban rent, which this thesis works to develop. To do this, we discuss classical and neoclassical theories of rent and production.

\section{The classical theory of rent and the distribution}
Cultivated land provides a stream of benefits in the form of agricultural products.
Prior to the industrial revolution, most people in Europe lived on and worked the land, primarily producing food, with ownership concentrated in the hands of a few landowners.  Agricultural production played such a central role in the economy that landownership was the basis of wealth, political power, and social distinction.   

For early economists, all wealth appeared to come from the land. The Physiocrats in particular, a school of \gls{political economy} in 18$^{th}$ century France, emphasized that land is the source of all wealth, that only agricultural labour was genuinely productive.\footnote{They argued, based on the productivity of land, that government policy should not interfere with the operation of natural economic laws. Within this framework, they were the first to frame labour as the source of value. Marx, extending the approach to the industrial economy, generalized the analysis, treating industrial labour as generating a surplus as well, as we discuss in \ref{section-rent-and-industrial-capital}, but excluding other workers.} They argued that tradespeople, professionals, clergy, and aristocrats were nonproductive. 
Rent theory originated in this land-based agricultural society. Landowners controlled access to the means of production and charged for access. 
The income landowners extracted was what economists called \gls{economic rent}, or \gls{land rent}.
Given the importance of land to overall economic productivity, the theory of rent emerged as a primary way of understanding the economy, and therefore the distribution of wealth in this period.

\subsection{Historical development of classical rent theory}
Alvin Saunders Johnson wrote in 1902 ``[o]f the concrete forms of income that have usually been classed as surplus, the rent of land was the earliest to be defined; and so prominent a position has been given to it that the terms `rent' and `surplus' have come to be used interchangeably'' \cite{johnsonRentModernEconomic1902}. 

David Ricardo provided the canonical presentation of the classical theory of rent \cite{ricardoEssayInfluenceLow1815} in 1815.\footnote{Classical rent theory originated with thinkers such as Richard Cantillon (1680s--1734), Fran\c{c}ois Quesnay (1694--1774), the marquis de Mirabeau (1715--1789), Anne-Robert-Jacques Turgot (1727--1781) and Adam Smith (1723--1790), and received its classic statement in Ricardo (1772--1823). Nearly contemporaneous thinker, Johann Heinrich von Th\"unen (1783--1850) developed a planning model to guide the location of economic activities for an urban-agricultural society. A version of that model was reinvented in urban geography by William Alonzo.} 
 Ricardo defines rent in relation to who claims the surplus productivity of the land, %this idea about the productivity of land, and who claims that value, 
saying ``[b]y rent I always mean the remuneration given to the landlord for the use of the original power of the land'' \cite{ricardoEssayInfluenceLow1815}. The key term in that definition is ``the original power of the land.'' In the classical tradition, rent is the surplus produced by labour, using land, that is claimed by landowners by virtue of their ownership of the land. The price of the corn would include payment for working the land and for transporting, storing, and selling the product, but the residual that was rent was a payment for the virtue of the land not the contribution of the landlord.

For Ricardo, \gls{land rent} is thus a kind of \gls{surplus value}, that is, an amount available after the costs of production have been paid, the term rent came to be used interchangeably with this more general concept in much of the classical work on rent and the term rent has been used in a more general sense to other kinds of surplus value, as well as land rents.

In Ricardo's time, economic rent and the rent paid by farmers to use the land were almost interchangeable. Landowners `rented out' land. The level of rent charged might not be exactly the economic rent, but in a labour-surplus economy\footnote{Between 1604 and 1914 over 5,200 enclosure Bills were enacted by Parliament which related to just over a fifth of the total area of England, amounting to some 6.8 million acres. From the 1750s enclosure by parliamentary Act became the norm. In Scotland  between 1750 to 1860 the  Highland Clearances  evicted a significant number of tenants in the Scottish Highlands and Islands, mostly in two phases from 1750 to 1860. Enclosures and clearances created a large pool of essentially minimum wage labour that supported industrialization and drove British migrations to the colonies.} landlords had enormous bargaining power, and charged tenant farmers rents that tended to approximate the value of the \gls{surplus}.\footnote{It is important to remember that there was always a conventional level of rent reflecting the power relations between the classes and anchoring the level of rent extraction that was possible.} 

%, and rent as a price tended to approximate \gls{economic rent}. 
%Ricardo used this concept of rent to build out a theory answered answer the social question `who gets the surplus?' This was an approach to understanding the distribution of wealth.

Ricardo was interested, in particular, in the division of the surplus among the classes of society:  which is to say, to the owners of land, labour, and capital.\begin{quotation}
 ``The produce of the earth---all that is derived from its surface by the united application of labour, machinery, and capital, is divided among three classes of the community; namely, the proprietor of the land, the owner of the stock or capital necessary for its cultivation, and the labourers by whose industry it is cultivated. ...  But in different stages of society, the proportions of the whole produce of the earth which will be allotted to each of these classes, under the names of rent, profit, and wages, will be essentially different''  \cite{ricardoEssayInfluenceLow1815}. CHECK SOURCE.
\end{quotation}
Ricardo's concern with the distribution of the surplus in an agricultural economy reflected the social concerns of his time. Primarily agricultural, the increasing globalization of trade in the early stages of the industrial revolution,\footnote{The Industrial Revolution is usually described as beginning around 1760 and having significantly transformed society by about 1820--1840.} was driving both rising overall wealth and greater poverty for many in the working class.

Understanding rent was essential for policy analysis. The Physiocrats focused on land and on the rents to understand tax policy. Ricardo applied rent theory to explain the effect of tariffs. For Ricardo this theory provided insight into whether Britain should open its doors to corn from the colonies.\footnote{ This was the debate over the Corn Laws (1794-1846), a set duties on grain imports into Britain to protect British agriculture from outside competition. In Britain, ``corn'' was the generic name for cereal crops. The full title of Ricardo's essay explains his purpose" \textit{An Essay on the Influence of a Low Price of Corn on the Profits of Stock, Showing the Inexpediency of Restrictions on Importation: With Remarks on Mr Malthus' Two Last Publications: `An Inquiry into the Nature and Progress of Rent,' and `The Grounds of an Opinion on the Policy of restricting the Importation of Foreign Corn.'} }

% it was a period increasing overall wealth in Europe, in which in many cases the living condition of the working class declined \cite{GET-industrial-inequality}. The wealth came from the increasing globalization of trade in the early stages of the industrial revolution but seemed to enrich primarily a small class of people in a position to benefit.  
% agriculture and the distribution of the surplus reflected the social concerns of his time.  Europe had primarily agricultural economic system and  %in Northern Europe,  and at a time when the benfits of the social changes seemed to benefit a few.

Prior to this, international relationships centred on studies of the military. As colonization changed the relationship between countries and trade became central, the study of \gls{political economy} became more significant.}


% It's easy enough to see how this concept would evolve into the two different usages of the term rent. Because it is the profit for the land, which is related to payments for the land. At the time, the feudal ownership structures meant that the value of the land was structured differently. Tenants did not pay to occupy the land the way that people and businesses do today. Rather the value of owning land was reflected in the distribution from production. The term later split to reflect both the way land is currently valued (i.e rent payments to occupy) and the surplus value that was how land was valued in the period of clssical econmics with it's feadul structures. Rent became payment to landlord because under feudalism, the surplus went to the landlords. Thenn the term diverged into the two distinct meanings used colloquially and in a technical context by Economists )

\subsection{Locational value in agricultural markets}
Location is at the center of the classical theory of rent. The role of locational value in the theory of \gls{rent} can be illustrated with the story of a carter. The carter transports agricultural products, for instance potatoes, from farms to sell in town. %If the carter has a transportation monopoly---owning the only suitable wagon in the region. 
There is a price for potatoes in town and a lower price at the farm gate. The carter buys potatoes from farmers at the cost of production, transports them to town, and resells them at the higher price in the urban market. What remains of the price gap, after subtracting labour and vehicle costs, is profit. % for the carter. SEPERATE OUT QUESTION OF WHO GETS THE PROFIT.

The cost of transporting the potatoes depends on how close farms are to market.  
%In this story the carter captures all of the land rents by exploiting a transportation monopoly. 
The net return thus declines with distance from town. Beyond a certain distance, the costs of the trip will eat up all profit. That is the farthest distance the carter will travel to purchase potatoes. It marks the \gls{extensive margin} of agriculture.

Figure~\ref{fig-rent-ricardo}, shows the total transportation costs as the darker, grey area. The lighter,  yellow triangle is profit for the carter. The carter makes a `profit' on the trip to the farm nearest to town, a smaller profit farther from town, and no profit on any farms beyond this point.\footnote{Note the similarity with Alonzo's urban model, illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig-rent-alonzo}, in Chapter~\ref{chapter-space}.} 
Together these two triangles represent the  value of the `product of the earth,' but only the upper triangle is a social \gls{surplus}. The lower triangle is the amount of value expended on transportation. The social surplus was termed the `\gls{produit net}' by the Physiocrats. This surplus may go to the landlord, the carter, the merchant or the consumer, depending %on the social relations that prevail. %Land rents may or may not go to the landowner, depending 
on their relative power. 
If the carter has a transportation monopoly---owning the only suitable wagon in the region, the carter may claim the profit. The surplus is called rent if it's captured by the landowner. If if goes to the carter, it's usually called profit. In modern supply and demand analysis it would be recognized as `\gls{producer surplus},' which is the difference between what a producer gets for a good and what they would be willing to accept.

\subsubsection{Differential rents}
In much of the discussion, Ricardo emphasized differential land fertility rather than distance to market. 
The difference in earnings between the poorest land in production and a more fertile or better located field was what could be claimed by landlords as a rent. 
At the farthest point, whether in fertility or distance, what Ricardo called the \gls{extensive margin}, land \gls{rent} falls to zero.\footnote{Ricardo carefully distinguished the \gls{intensive margin} and the \gls{extensive margin}. The extensive margin is where the most distant land worth cultivating is found given the cost of transportation, or the underlying fertility of the land. Farmers won't cultivate land beyond the extensive margin, because there is not profit. 

The intensive margin, on the other hand, can be seen as the limit to increasing the economic return from  particular piece of land by applying fertilizer, draining, or paying more workers. In modern, \gls{marginalist} terms, the intensive margin is reached when the revenue generated by an additional amount of fertilizer on a plot of land just begins to exceed the marginal cost of fertilizer.} If the merchant's price goes up, or costs go down, the \gls{extensive margin} moves farther out, and more land comes into production.\footnote{Our examples illustrate the principle with uniformly productive land and a single product. Johann Heinrich von Th\"unen, in \textit{The Isolated State} (\textit{Der isolierte Staat} \cite{vonthunenIsolirteStaatBeziehung1826}), 1826, provided a more complex analysis based on the same principles.}

The story of the carter emphasizes that land rents are locational rents, derived from both the proximity of land to the market and the productivity of the land. Just as there is more surplus for land closer to market, there is more surplus for land that is more productive. Good land produces more market value for the same cost as the poorest land in production. The poorest land in production just barely justified the cost of production. If farming didn't justify the costs, the farmer would not cultivate the land.

\subsection{Surplus in the industrial age}

Even as Ricardo was writing, the industrial revolution was already changing what Marx called the mode of production.  As the economy shifted  from overwhelmingly agricultural to largely industrial,  through %industrialization in 
the 18$^{th}$  and 19$^{th}$ centuries, more and more of society's wealth came from industrial production, in factories with human labour. The influence of landowners declined and it became increasingly important for economists to theorize industrial production. A theory of value in which only land produced value was no longer sufficient, even as an approximation. 



Marx, (1818--1883), was born three years after Ricardo published his \textit{Essay on the Price of Corn}. 
By the time Marx began writing for the radical newspaper, \textit{Rhineland News}, Ricardo had been dead 20 years, the industrial revolution had been underway for almost a century, and European economies were already largely structured around manufacturing. 
Marx  proposed that a core flaw of capitalism resides in excessive claims placed by privately owned capital as against labor on the economic value created by their combination.
His \emph{Capital A Critique of Political Economy} %: Volume I, Book One: The Process of Production of Capital}  
(1867) reshaped the discussion of rents  and brought into focus the distibution of the new surplus generated by industrial capital, and argue that the appropriation of that surplus by capital was a form of class exploitation analogous to the capture of rents by landlords.  


In industrialization factories produce goods which sell for a price at the market. 
As with agriculture there were factors of production contributing to the output. Factories were built on land, but on such small part of land that it was relatively inconsequential. 
Factories combined, labour and machinery, with this capital investment. 
People be came interested in what share of the return went to what factor of production.
There is a large upfront capital cost to build the factories, but afterwards they can make many replicas of a good cheaply. At a certain point Marx made the link that this actually changes things to make capital replicable. 
The value is created.


 % ***E MORE ACCURATE TO SAY HE was exploring this because it was what he saw than shifted attention.
%  In the manufacturing economy, the owners of the capital % machinery, buildings, and even working capital to fund the workers until the product can be sold, 
%  were reorganizing production. Capital was scarce, and the owners of the scarce factor were able to appropriate the surplus value. % ***E FLESH OUT THIS DESCRIPTION OF THE KEY FEATURES OF TEH MANUFACTURING ECONMY. ALOS SPECIFCAL DEFINE CAPITAL CAN WHY IT MATTERS
%  %This contribution must be accumulated from their profits in the preceding cycle of production,  and has to be reinvested once the revenues of the current round have come in and the bills have been paid. Marx actually describes a circuit of capital from its form as money to its form as physical capital. 
% Marx emphasized that labour itself in this situation  became a commodity used to produce goods for exchange in the market. %there's surplus labour,  %Like Ricardo,  Marx saw the appropriation of surplus as without moral justification. 

Marx also identified a dynamic feature of capitalist systems that would play a central role in the evolution of economic thought: productive capital is not fixed as land is, but expands as surplus is reinvested. At any rate of return this growth of capital is exponential and tends to outrun demand. %This creates an economy that can, and according to Marx, must grow. It also introduces challenges created by the capitalists' need to reinvest their growing accumulation of surplus value.  
For Marx it followed that  the rate of profit had to fall leading to a capitalist crisis.\footnote{In some analyses, the financialization of housing emerges from investors seeking to invest capitalist surplus value as profit rates fall, see for instance David Harvey's work on \gls{the second circuit of capital} \cite{GET_david_harvey}.} 
Marx's critiques of the way that the social product was distributed and its tendency to periodic crisis represented serious challenges for social theorists 

Marx was far from being the most influential critic of the system. Henry George, whom we discuss was ,  Other economists  would find ways to normalize the  excessive returns to capital. The neoclassical economists like Alfred Marshall concluded that competition among capitalists  would indeed drive profits to zero, but the result would not be crisis, but efficiency. argued that  

Among the early economists money was understood as nothing but a means of exchange and a convenient store of value. It was not productive in itself. It was Marx who emphasized that the control of money also provided control of production and the ability to claim all of the residual after all the real inputs had been paid for.

\section{Neoclassical theory }

Alfred Marshall (1842--1924) was one of the most influential economists of his time and one of the founders of the school of neoclassical economics. His book \textit{Principles of Economics} (1890) \cite{marshallPrinciplesEconomics1890} was the dominant economic textbook in England for many years. It brought the ideas of supply and demand, marginal utility, and costs of production into a coherent whole and contributed many new theoretical insights. 
The ``neoclassical revolution'' in economics, which Marshall helped found, was a movement that extended and corrected classical theory while at the same time introducing the extensive use of mathematics to the discipline. Marshall made significant contributions on both these fronts. 

Marshall was one of the theorists who reframed Marx's ruthless competition of capital as a positive force.  
He pointed out that, in a competitive market with \gls{free entry}, {scarcity profits}, i.e. rent for capital, would normally be competed away as entrepreneurs entered the market in pursuit of those \gls{excess profits}. The presence of higher-than-normal profits would lead new firms to enter the industry, increasing supply, driving down prices, and eliminating the higher profits.  This would be a good thing, resulting in economic efficiency.\footnote{To understand how competition would eliminate quasi-rents, we can go back to the story of the carter who was capturing the agricultural rents. Since carts are a form of reproducible capital, there would always be another potential carter who could have a cart built and enter the market to claim a share of the surplus. In this newly competitive market, both would have to offer better prices to the farmers. Profits in carting would fall to zero and the landlords would again capture the land rents. After paying farmers, and paying off the loan to buy their carts, carters would eventually earn just a competitive wage.} Marshall argued that eliminating  excess returns would help bring prices down. It would not eliminate the return to capital rather investors would only receive a `normal'  rate of return, which is usually defined as the average rate of return on all investments.

It is important to remember that neoclassical economics did not overthrow the insights of the classical economists.\footnote{ Marshall emphasized this point. See for example Clark's introduction to his \textit{Principles of Economics}: ``Some of the best work of the present generation has indeed appeared at first sight to be antagonistic to that of earlier writers; but when it has had time to settle down into its proper place, and its rough edges have been worn away, it has been found to involve no real breach of continuity in the development of the science.''} It provided increased precision and power, and it shifted attention from questions of class and distribution to deriving efficiency conditions. Economics became less a collection of thoughts about the economy and more a mathematical edifice that embodied those thoughts in a rigorously consistent way.

HOW MATH DEVELOPED.
BRIDGES AND ENGINEERS - OVERVIEW OF INTRO OF MATH
Classical economics relied almost entirely on verbal formulations.
THE CLASSICAL WAS MORE VERBAL
There was also a big shift in tools/approach  YOUR MATH SECTIONS ABOUT CALCULUS. math allowed for certain kidnds of analysis.

Specifically, to understand production something - INTRODUCE the production function + DEFINE.... then say how relates to ricardo

The concept of a production function used by the increasingly mathematical neoclassical economists brought Ricardo's notions of intensive and extensive margins to the centre of economic theory. If we write Ricardo's implicit production function as a neoclassical economist would, \footnote{
%Although Ricardo did not % speak of a production function per se
% write down an explicit production function, 
Stopping short of writing an explicit production function, Ricardo did generate numerical examples to demonstrate comparative advantage and other theorists, such as the physiocrats, von Th\"unen and Marx, developed models still cited today, however models were not at the center of classical theorizing.} we would get:

\begin{equation} 
Y=F(K,L,N).
\label{eqn-production-ricardo}
\end{equation} 
where $Y$ is output, $K$ is capital invested, $L$ is labour and $N$ is the natural resource land.\footnote{This makes it a three-factor model of production.  In principle, any number of factors can be included.}  Ricardo assumes diminishing returns to all factors. 

If we differentiate the output function $F$ with respect to labour $L$ we get an expression called the \gls{marginal product} of labour. It is the amount that adding one more worker would add to total output. American economist, John Bates Clark (1847-1938), made the link, 
% It was a small step to

% and was the path to ever more arcane insights.
% *E WHILE THIS IS INTERESTING AS AN ACCOUNT OF THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN ECONOMICS AND THE PUBLIC, I'M NOT SURE HOW IT SETS UP WHERE YOU ARE GOING WITH THIS CHAPTER. CAN YOU BRING IT BACK TO RENT OR DISTRIBUTION, HOW THE NEW APPROACHES RELATE TO PROBLEMS YOU ARE LOOKING AT IN THIS THESIS?

% \section{Neoclassical production theory}
% attempts to identify the precise \gls{functional form} that would describe the contributions of labour, capital, and income to output.
% \subsubsection{Classical production theory using neoclassical notation}
% The mathematical approach led to efforts to develop a formal mathematical production function, that used the same concepts, labour, land, capital etc from the classical analysis, but formalized their relationship. 
%Classical theorists did not write down formal theories of production, but there's an implicit one in their theory. We can write it as a function, to trace the connection with later work. Ricardo, for example, did not write down a formal production function as later \gls{neoclassical} theorists would, but his verbal production theory can be put in the notation neoclassical economists later developed. In modern notation, Ricardo's production model can be written: 
% *THIS IS CONFUSING DID YOU PUT IT IN THIS FORM OR DID THE MARGINALISTS. NOTE.. %JUST ABOVE YOU SAY THE MARGINALISTS STARTED TO DO THIS. iS THIS AN EXAMPLE? OR YOU DOING WHAT THEY ALSO DID? cLARIFY. OR THIS CONFUSION MIGHT JUST GO AWAY WHEN YOU FILL OUT MORE EXAMPLES ABOVE
%Ricardo does not specify a functional form, but, %like mathematical neoclassical economists, 
% The  rent, $\mathcal{R}$, that the landlord receives is the total market value of the potatoes produced minus the cost of the capital employed in improving the land and the wage bill for the labour employed. %: 
% % \begin{equation} 
% % \mathcal{R}= PQ-rk-wl
% % \label{eqn-rent-ricardo}
% % \end{equation} 
% % Equation~\ref{eqn-rent-ricardo} makes it clear that 
% The rent is a residual or a \gls{surplus}. The land is not paid for its services. %The value of the land is the \gls{present discounted value} of the surplus it generates for the owner, that is what it would be worth paying now, to capture the future rents from that land.

% Ricardo's analysis of rents  can be expressed by focusing only on land:

% \begin{equation} 
% Y=F(L,N).
% \label{eqn-production-ricardo-2}
% \end{equation} 
% while most modern neoclassical treatments of production simplify by omitting land and emphasizing capital:\begin{equation} 
% Y=F(K,L).
% \label{eqn-production}
% \end{equation}  
% This makes sense for a number of reasons. The economy has shifted from agriculture to industry and the focus of economic theory has shifted to manufacturing processes.

%Furthermore, according to the Ricardian theory, rent is a surplus above cost. It does not, therefore enter into price. Land is a fixed factor for society as a whole that is not consumed in  the process of production.  Neoclassical treatments of production focus price determination based on the cost of the last unit used, the marginal  unit of input, while rents are generated on all of the inframarginal units, those units used earlier, which are more productive. The marginal unit of land generates no rents. In neoclassical analysis, the rents disappeared from view for this reason. This difference is at the heart of the distinction between classical and neoclassical economic theory. 
% #E this distinction is because of the actual structural difference in the societies? Also because of the differ tools? and apporaches? 

 %The Principles tells us that as cultivation is extended and exchange increases, profits fall while rents increase.

% Rent now however competes with what is essentially another approach to distribution, developed through the neoclassical tradition. % This new approach is exciting and successful but in some ways displaces what went before. (our work is a synthesis)
% Classical theories of distribution showed that ownership of a scarce and non-produced factor, land, was the basis of rent extraction by the class of landowners. IN WHAT PERIOD SHIFT TO INDUSTRIAL ... Increasingly something else was happening in the industrial economy, that this older approach to distribution and rents did not seem to explain. WHAT THING????
%As industrial production became more important, economists shifted their focus to how prices, especially the prices of factors of production, were determined, and to how the prices allocated incomes to the factors of production. % THE SHIFT IN THEORY WAS ALSO EFFECTED BY CHANGES IN THE MATH

% Despite the successes of rent as a way of explaining the distribution of the surplus in the agricultural economy, this new, neoclassical, approach ultimately displaced rent theory as the central theory of distribution in economics.\footnote{Rent remained important and has continued in modern economics as we discuss in Section~\ref{section-rent-modern-economics}.}  %was displaced in the analysis of distribution as this new approach came to dominate.

 The introduction of functions and the use of calculus, which  made it much easier to  derive what came to be called the ``marginal conditions,'' which can serve as rules for efficient choice. The results of this new style are analytically more precise than the verbal statements they replace, and more easily communicated accurately for those with some mathematical skill. The approach also tended to lay bare the precise condition---the background assumptions---that must hold for results to be true. It also allowed economists to analyze complex cases that were difficult to state verbally, however, a cost of this approach is that economics became less accessible. The mathematical approach led quickly to the articulation of a new theory of distribution through the work of economists like Marshall and John Bates Clark.

\section{The Neoclassical theory of distribution}
American economist, John Bates Clark (1847-1938), a near contemporary of Marshall, was one of the most influential American economists of the day and one of the founders of the American Economic Association.  Like Marshall, Clark was major contributor to the development of what came to be called `neoclassical' economics. 

Clark developed the essential link between distribution and the emerging understanding of production in an industrial economy, by linking the production function directly to distribution.\footnote{Clark was not alone in this work. Marshall apparently derived the results independently, Philip Wicksteed proved a crucial product exhaustion theorem in 1894, and others proposed that some, but not all, factors would receive their marginal products.} His 1891 \textit{Distribution as Determined by a Law of Rent} \cite{clarkDistributionDeterminedLaw1891}\footnote{Clark's work engaged with both foundational economic principles and with the ethical and distributional implications of those principles. His other works include: \textit{The Philosophy of Wealth} (1886), \textit{The Distribution of Wealth} (1899) and \textit{Essentials of Economic Theory} (1907).}

 argued that, given competition and homogeneous factors of production labour and capital, the division of the social product will be according to the productivity of the last (or marginal) physical input of units of labour and capital. If you know how factors contribute to production, you know how they will be paid, so you have a theory of distribution, grounded in the theory of production. This solved a core puzzle that was increasingly important to understanding the industrial economy.

% Clark was initially a socialists, before changing his mind and by 1986 he was publicly}
Clark  argued that the distributional pattern that he saw emerging under capitalist industrialization was fair. Responding to the Marxists and what he described as the ``indictment that hangs over society'' that the wage system involves ``exploiting labour,'' Clark wrote in his 1899 \textit{Distribution of Wealth}:
\begin{quotation}
It is the purpose of this work to show that the distribution of the income of society is controlled by a natural law, and that this law, if it worked without friction, would give to every agent of production the amount of wealth which that agent creates. However wages may be adjusted by bargains freely made between individual men i.e., without labour unions and other ``market imperfections,'' the rates of pay that result from such transactions tend, it is here claimed, to equal that part of the product of industry which is traceable to the labour itself; and however interest, i.e. profit, may be adjusted by similarly free bargaining, it naturally tends to equal the fractional product that is separately traceable to capital.
\end{quotation}
He argued, as Marshall did, that in most cases competitive forces were strong enough that the power of the owners of companies, capital, or resources would not matter much. The potential for profit would motivate investment to go where it could productively produce value, but competition would eliminate the excess profits and therefore any exploitation,  over time. 

% Assume away power relations, then power relations will have no effect on prices. Removing one set of powers, state/person/worker, and unchecking the other side will have a naturally ballancing effect one economic affairs.

% Clark was correct, of course, but, 
% Clark made some effort to argue that this was fair. 

By emphasizing that land and capital were factors of production logically and morally equivalent to labour. Clark thus obscured the fact that it was not the capitalist or the landowner that contributed to production but rather  the land or the socially produced purchasing power they held legal ownership rights over. Later economists tend to accept that distribution under competition is, while perhaps not fair, is at least efficient in a specific sense.\footnote{The result is known  in economics as the ``First Fundamental Theorem of Welfare Economics.'' The basic idea that markets can approach and efficient outcome goes back to Adam Smith, and was gradually developed  over 70 years until Kenneth Arrow and Gérard Debreu (separately, 1951) each gave a satisfactorily general proof in 1951. In their 1986 paper ``Externalities in Economies with Imperfect Information and Incomplete Markets,''
Bruce Greenwald and Joseph Stiglitz showed that the fundamental welfare theorems do not hold if there are incomplete markets or imperfect information. There are always incomplete markets and  imperfect information.}%Clark, also advanced the concept of social capital as a permanent, ongoing stream of future incomes out of which all productive inputs, including capital goods, are temporarily taken for a charge (interest) \cite{CLARKBRITANICA}} %``John Bates Clark'' Encyclopedia Britannica, https://www.britannica.com/biography/John-Bates-Clark.

% However, it is very successful.

% In a competitive market, instead of persistent land rents defining a persistent class's power and resources, those who created value had a transient claim to the surplus, under continual competitive pressure from others who might offer the same thing or something else.

% It was not until 1867 that  the first volume of \textit{Das Kapital},  was published, pulling together 20 years of Marx's analysis of the capitalist economy. \textit{Das Kapital} proposes an explanation of the ``laws of motion'' of the mode of production from its origins to its future by describing the dynamics of the accumulation of capital.

% \subsection{Industrial production}
% A feature of the industrial economy, was that these economies were competitive in a way traditional agricultural production, that depended on claims on limited land, were not.

%WE COULD CONSIDER MOVING THIS HERE, FROM RENT TO THE SPACE CHAPTER, AND THEN USING IT AS A LINK EXPLAIN URBAN THEORY, THAT IT MISSES DISTRIBUTION, OUR APPROACH, AND SHOWING THERE IS A LONG HISTORY OF DISTRIBUTION IN URBAN SPATIAL ANALYSIS THAT HAS BEEN LOST- THIS IS A PRECURSOR FOR THE WAY WE BRING RENT BACK INTO THE URBAN ANALYSIS?
The neoclassicals appeared to have dispensed with rent and they downplayed the importance of economic surplus, but neither problem went away. With industrialization, economic activity was increasingly centred on cities. Henry George (1839--1897) returned to the theory of land rent with a new insight based on the emergence of the capitalist city. George  published his most famous work, \textit{Progress and Poverty} in 1879\cite{georgeProgressPovertyInquiry1973}. It sold millions of copies worldwide, and its publication is  often cited as marking as the beginning of the Progressive Era. George is still claimed as a primary intellectual influence by both classical liberals and socialists.\footnote{Marx, however, saw the Single Tax platform as a step backwards.} 

The owners of urban land,  said George,  extract surplus in the same way that owners of agricultural land do in Ricardo's analysis. ``[w]ith the growth of population, land grows in value, and the men who work it must pay more for the privilege.''  Where Marx saw the extravagant productivity of capital as the source of capitalist rent, George saw the extraction of wealth by land speculators as the mechanism that let owners claim surplus value. George's work represents an important development in the theory of rent for the story we tell. The classical economists agreed that rents are unearned income. They did not emphasize, as George did, that land rents arise from labour's proximity to urban population and production. To be fair, it was not lack of understanding, that the classical omission of urban rents reveals, but rather lack of interest in urban production, in a primarily agricultural economy.

  %  % Ricardo von Thunen, Marx, Cantillon all grasped the notion of proximity to the market as part of the source land rent. The discussions seem to not gone farther than discussions of diffeerential and rents, however.  I just am not aware of them explicitly examining urban land rent for residential or even industrial purposes. 

According to its proponents, George's analysis  has important policy implications. Since land rent is not created by its owners, George argued that land rent should be seen as a social income---that it could be used to pay for the needs of the community.\footnote{George's emphasis on land rents parallels the view of the Physiocrats, who concluded that agricultural \gls{ground rents} should be the source of most or all taxes. They defined ground rent as that portion of all rent which is attributable only to the size and location of the parcel.} % The clearest statement of this view is found in \textit{Progress and Poverty} when he wrote ``We must make land common property.''
George's analysis led to the {single tax} movement, which sought to shift all taxation to land  and resource rents.\footnote{Among the most prominent economists who have spoken in favour of a version of George's single tax are Alfred Marshal \cite{marshallPrinciplesEconomics1890}, %p718, 
Arthur Pigou \cite{pigouPolicyLandTaxation1909}, Milton Friedman, Paul Samuelson, Robert Solow, Paul Krugman, Joseph Stiglitz \cite{stiglitzTheoryLocalPublic1977}, and %p282,

Neoclassical economics has not abandoned rent theory. It has simply moved it to the side to focus  on the exchange price and the marginal conditions satisfied in exchange, which marginalist techniques explain more satisfactorily. Despite this, The  classical concept of rent  is embedded in a great deal of standard analysis.

 % ADD BACK *** Modern economists generally focus  on the exchange price and the marginal conditions satisfied in exchange, which neoclassical economics explains more satisfactorily They appear to have abandoned rents as a central concept, but it  persists in slightly covert forms at the centre  neoclassical economics.

Both of these concepts are variants of rent and are essential in demonstrating the efficiency of a markets and the social losses due to \gls{monopoly}, \gls{monopsony}, regulation, and taxes. Consumer surplus is the sum of rents that accrue to the class of consumers (buyers). It is an \gls{inframarginal} quantity, like land  rent, that accrues to the class of landowners. It arises because consumers have differing capacity to produce  utility with the good, just as landowners have lands with different abilities to produce agricultural output. Producer surplus corresponds precisely to land rent.

\section{Summary}
%Neoclassical theory represented a shift in the central apparatus of economic theory that made sense in the context of three broader shifts in the world/environment/context. First, the shift to industrial production, as manufacturing became increasingly central to output, where, unlike with fixed land stock, new companies could enter and compete away profits. 

% MODE OF PRODUCTION
% STATE OF THE WORLD
% METHODOLOGICAL FRONTIER

% ACTUALLY MARKS A SECOND THEORY OF DISTRIBUTION.
% PROFIT COMPETED AWAY, 
 % successful and captured something important

% With the centrality  and the success of the neoclassical approach, with essentially a different underlying model of how the economy distributes surplus value, rent has played less of a central role.
We have examined the historical development  of rent theory and its role in distribution theories as the necessary background for our development of a modern theory of urban rent. We explained how the concept of economic rent arises in an agricultural economy, and who gets the rents in that type of economy. We then gave an account of how rent theory and the classical distribution theory was pushed into the background as neoclassical theorists analysed the industrial market economy that emerged after the industrial revolution using the  modern theory of production. In the next chapter we introduce 20$^{th}$ century urban models that are essentially an application of classical rent theory.


We have also sketched the  two great theories of \gls{distribution} in economics. The first and oldest is based on the classical concept of rent as explained  by David Ricardo \cite{ricardoEssayInfluenceLow1815}, in which owners of land are able to extract a value beyond what they contribute based on their ownership of a scarce resource. The second is the marginalist approach, developed by John Bates Clark and others, in which workers and other factors  in competitive markets receive the \gls{marginal value-product} of their contribution to production. The two theories coexist and even mingle in modern economics, but it is the marginalist approach that dominates economic teaching. 

Both theories developed in response to the social and economic conditions of the periods in which they emerged. Both attempt to explain where the output of society ends up within society. They are, at their heart, stories of who %can or does 
claims what share of production.
The classical theory of rentl inked a spatially distributed economy, agriculture, with the class structure of the society of the time. 
The neoclassical approach does not contradict the classical view of rents, it simply displaces the analysis to the point where a competitive equilibrium prevails, and shifts attention away from the distribution of land rents.  Carey and Lachim \cite{careySomethingNothingHow2019} observe,  however,that, ``[t]he persistent and growing profit share across a range of advanced economies and within industries fundamentally challenges the assumption of perfect competition and suggests that growing market power is at the heart of many of the economic challenges in America today.'' We are now arguably in a third dominant mode of production, centered on  human capital and urban production. %\footnote{When a new dominant mode or age emerges, the old one doesn't go away. Stone work and bronze work still persist, agriculture and industrial production still persist, they are not however the force driving economic and social relations in the way the were when they were dominant as technologies and modes of production\cite{oldworldsdon'tdie}} 
This new mode of production does not yet have a corresponding theory of distribution.

This thesis works to fill that gap. We address the gap by re-introducing rent in the classical sense within an urban model which distributes wages and profits as prescribed by  the neoclassical model. Rent is important in this new economy---and takes a rising share---contradicting Marshall. 


 % \Gls{class} structure, or how different classes participate in production changes over time as modes of production change. When Ricardo was writing, the economy was still largely reflected feudal social relations in that most land ownership originated in feudal military power. %Even the land of the nobility was divided up into smaller parcels run by knights or vassals. Both of these groups traded military support for land in the local manors. As higher ranking people, knights often presided over an entire manor, while vassals presided only over the land needed to support their families.
 % (IE DESCRIBE role of labour land, capital under feudalism and how this was changing in that period.) 
 
% ADD The evolution of the mode of production has continued, with human capital rather than land or industrial capital increasing the source of the social surplus. The concept of rent is specifically relate to surplus and enabled Ricardo to first talk about how is key to distribution within the economy, amongst classes.  Ricardo essentially developed his concept of Rent to explain the dynamics of distribution between classes. 
% The distribution of rents in the urban model affects urban productivity in our model.
%***E FINANCIALIZATION IS ABOUT SURPLUS. CURRENT THINKING ABOUT FINANCIALIZATION HAS NOT BEEN NOT BEEN PUT INTO A FORMAL MODEL. FORMAL MODELS COME FROM COME FROM THE NEO-CLASSICAL TRADITION. 



% The need to be near a market or prodduction center is easily seen by considering a population at the carrying capacity of the land with individuals supporting themselves using purely local resources. There can be no land rent in this case. If a city rises that must be supplied from those still on the land, land close enough to the city will generate land rent. The value of the land is created by proximity to the city.

%  no separate and comprehensive data are provided on the amounts of land rents and subsoil rents charged and earned, because they are not officially regarded as part of value-added, and consequently are not included in the calculation of GDP (except for the value of productive lease contracts)     https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_and_absolute_ground_rent#Rent_in_macro-economics    \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_and_absolute_ground_rent#Rent_in_macro-economics}{Wikipediat article on differential rent}


%   *****. \subsubsection{MOVE/CUT? Profit vs rent in the story of the carter}
% % PROBABLY LOTS OF EXTRA TO COMMENT OUT HERE
% We have illustrated the story using a carter with a monopoly on transportation services. If instead there were a monopoly landowner, and the transportation industry were competitive, the landowner would pay carters and farmer workers their minimum cost and keep the profit. In this case economists would call the monopoly profits \glspl{rent}. If the carter claims the surplus, we tend to call it \gls{profit}. If the landowner claims it, we tend to call it \gls{rent}. This is simply because the carter has to invest some capital, buy a cart, etc. For rents, you have to subtract the costs used to produce it. You didn't create the land, so the whole of the surplus can be expropriated. With the capitalist surplus, part of the surplus has to be appropriated to keep generating it. % bringinb tack the inheritance of one line of thinking, the common element that was actually prior in the analysis. That's why Marshal called it quasi-rent- because it will be competed away by tghe structure.-- it's not jsut the source, but the dynamical or transient nature of the surplus that makes it different.
% cities don't die. it's hard to make land rents disapear for varous reasons. When you tghink about converting it.. it's a spatial rent, that part of the land rent is a spatial rent, the land is diffferentiated spatially as ricardo's extensive margin.. someone else can expropriate a spatial rent other than the landowners. -- 
% debate about rban land rents- infinitely divisible.. and urban center coudl in pricnicple move.. 
% Yes urban centers are a tiny share of land, and yes in priciple they could be someone else, but in pracitce they can't. it's the people around it, and hte links airports to other centers, that make it the center. yess you can relase by going higher or changing zoning- realaxine potential energy... all that realiese is predicated on the fact that there is this spatial structure already.
% Modern work - develoepr is investing a certain amount to make living space.. described in xyz -- cite future work. not appropraiteing surplus
% CLARIFY - THEY ARE NOT RENTS IF THEY CARTER GETS THEM? WHAT DO WE CALL THEM %\footnote{In the modern economy, agricultural land rents may be captured by corporations,  either by owning the land or by controlling the supply chain.}  
 
 % MOVE? Landlord income in this example is thus a locational \gls{land rent} that exists because of the land's proximity to the market.

 
% Marshall's understanding of quasi-rents, or profits, that the surplus does not stay fixed relative to a good's distance from markets, prices come down. Goods get cheaper. If there is a profit, that's an incentive for another business to enter. There's a return to the owner of a factory, but if it's \gls{competitive}, there's free entry, and other businesses can come in and undercut the factory's price. New entrants compete away the profits, driving the price towards the costs of production.


%   ******. The distribution of these surplus incomes are not explained by the later neoclassical theory. 
%In fact they are assumed to be a transitory phenomenon that disappears as a result of free competitive market entry, even though profits and rents remain a substantial part of national income (20--25 percent) \cite{GET_Britannica} %\footnote{Schmitt, Hans Otto, Pen, Jan, Boulding, Kenneth E. and Kleinsorge, Paul Lincoln. ``distribution theory.''

% A formal relationship between xyx was increasingly important as the field got more formal/mathematical.

% The \gls{neoclassical} approaches to economic analysis built on the classical framework. They added  mathematical modelling and the use of calculus. Calculus made it much easier to derive formal statements of what came to be called `marginal conditions,' or rules for efficient choice. It also allowed economists to derive clear rules for complex cases that were difficult to state verbally. For example, the utilitarian goal of ``the greatest good for the greatest number'' which %is comprehensible but vague 
% could be translated into a guideline expressed in terms of the sums of individual marginal utilities equalling the marginal social cost for each good.

% % The 
%.  *****.   \subsubsection{The Cobb-Douglas Production Function}
% The above functions say what the factors of production are that shape output. They don't say what the function is: there's no specification of how the factors relate to output. Developing a more formal theory, in an age before computers where equations and calculus were the cutting edge for formal analysis, required specifying particular functional forms.

% In 1928, mathematician Charles Cobb and Economist Paul Douglas came up with a specific and convenient functional form \cite{cobbTheoryProduction1928}\footnote{The function had apparently previously been used by Knut Wicksell, Philip Wicksteed, and L\'eon Walras.} that captured much of what economists were talking about. The function is just a \gls{generalized arithmetic mean}:
%  \[Y=AK^\alpha L^\beta\]
%  where $A$ is a constant scale factor, now commonly called \gls{total factor productivity}. This function becomes the workhorse of neoclassical growth theory in the second half  of the 20th century. Our urban model is a direct heir to developments in neoclassical growth theory.
 
% %The Cobb Douglas function has several convenient features. One is that the sum of the coefficents tells us the degree of returns to scale. If $\alpha+\beta = 1$, we have constant returns to scale,

% %Another is that the coefficients of the factors, $\alpha$  and $\beta$ turn out to be the elasticities of output with respect to capital and labour respectively as well as the income share of the factor. These made it relatively easy for economists to combine national data on labour and capital stocks or income with output to test the model.

% The Cobb-Douglas form was developed and almost immediately tested against statistical evidence in the USA by Cobb and Douglas between 1927--1947. It was  their widely circulated empirical work seems to have permanently associated this simple function with Cobb and Douglas for economists.

This paper studies the long-run consequences of imperfect competition on growth and the sectoral distribution of skills within an R&D-based growth model with human capital accumulation. We find that steady-state growth is driven only by incentives to accumulate skills. In the model imperfect competition has a positive growth effect, while influencing the allocation of human capital to the different economic activities employing this factor input.

% Both the Solow (1956) growth model and its Ramsey-Cass-Koopmans counterpart featuring an endogenous saving rate (Ramsey, 1928; Cass, 1965; Koopmans, 1965) but treat technical change as purely exogenous.

% HOUSING RENT IN THE NATIONAL ACCOUNTS
%   Owner-occupied housing is included in Personal Consumption Expenditure because the National Income and Producgt Accounts (NIPAs) treat the owner-occupant as if it were a rental business, or in other words, a landlord renting to him or herself. That is, BEA imputes a value for the services of owner-occupied housing (space rent) based on the rents charged for similar tenant-occupied housing, and this value is included in GDP as part of personal consumption expenditures. This imputation is necessary in order for GDP to be invariant when housing units shift between tenant occupancy and owner occupancy.

%Ricardo  clearly understood and used the concept of diminishing marginal product. This shows in his use of the terms ``extensive margin'' and ``intensive margin'' to explain the income of the landowner. He focussed on the difference between the cost of production on a unit of land and the revenue generated. The landlord would rent out all the land which generated at least enough to pay all the costs. Anything in excess of the costs could be charged as land rent to a tenant farmer.

%Clearly in his model there are two basic productive factors, land and labour. The landlord  receives the surplus generated by the land and the rest of the value of production goes to labour.

% FOOTNOTE - RELATIONSHIP with marginalist distribution story ******** TODO Does the marginalist approach assume they are not exploited? Is it an experiment in examining the case where production is non-exploitative? 
% In a sense if labour gets the marginal value of their product, are they exploited. It's a matter of interpretation.  -It has an attraction 
%Clark tried to make an ethic of this. if everyone is being paid the marginal product of their labour. We know that's an efficient outcome. If it's efficient, is it also fair
%Is it possible someone's taking out an extra large fair. Yes. Not fair for simple classical reason that labour has been exploited in the past and that the current owner ship is a result of exploitation. The ownership of land introduces a kind of exploitation-- clearly exploitation if you claim that. 
%Lot's of marxists didn't like Henry George making it a locational question, they wanted to keep it located in the factory.
% You could - well what value did they create---in line with those other-- could interpret.. 
%What is the average value, because every worker is not just marginal, they're also average/identical. What is the value created by the whole of the workforce. Should they be paid the marginal value or the average value of their work.
%
%The avg value---declining.. 
%The demand for labour is declining--  
%Every infra marginal worker has been paid less than the avg contribution 
%Every infra marginal workers should - 
%every marginal worker should get the average wage.. that's fair.

%Get to the margin - that's what you pay.. that's what the next worker is worth to the firm. .. 5th' worker is paid more than the 10th. should it be averaged out and paid to all workers? paid to worker, or should the difference between top and the marginal goes to the firm---that's profit.. pay everyone the marginal value and keep the rest as profit.. 
%Effective labour has a higher marginal product.. - even higher - higher for the firm.. - but they don't have to pay the workers that... firms only have to pay enough to get their marginal individual cost down to the wage. The problem there is if they're making more profit they want to expand the workforce, but that wage only supports a certain size of city---they've got off raise the wage a bit.. so they face an upward sloping supply curve for labour=-- that's why you know there's an equilibrium.. declining product and upward sloping supply so they cross.
