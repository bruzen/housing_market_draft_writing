\chapter{Classical Antecedents of Modern Urban Rent Theory} \label{chapter-rent}

% #NEED TO ADD THAT THIS PAPER IS MODERN URBAN RENT THEORY. AND WHAT THAT MEANS, HOW IT RELATES TO DISTRIBUTION 
 In this chapter, we build a bridge from \gls{classical rent theory} to the modern theory of urban rent  which is described in the next chapter and to which this thesis contributes. We trace the development of theories of income distribution through the classical and neoclassical periods to provide context to our contribution to the development of a modern urban rent theory.  

 

The classical theory of rent was the foundation of the first satisfactory theory of income distribution. It linked a spatially distributed economy, agriculture, with the class structure of the society of the time. Modern urban theory explains the the spatial economy of the city in terms of land rents, but does not bring forward the distributional and class features derived by the classical economists. We correct that omission because they are necessary for our examination of the impact of \gls{financialization} on urban productivity. Along the way, we also explain the competing approach to distribution, has perhaps unintentionally left most modern economist with a tendency to overlook rents and to see rent theory as outdated. 
% ***E I LIKE THIS DESCRIPTIONABOVE. IT'S CLEAR AND HELPFUL. i THINK IT WOULD FIT BETTER IN THE PINTRODUCTION CHAPTER. IT EXPLAINS WHAT YOU ARE DOING WITH RENT THEORY, NOT JUST THE HISTORY, WHICH IS WHAT THIS CHAPTER IS ABOUT.


There are two dominant theories of \gls{distribution} in economics. The first and oldest is based on the classical concept of rent as explained  by David Ricardo \cite{ricardoEssayInfluenceLow1815}, in which owners of land are able to extract a value beyond what they contribute based on their ownership of a scarce resource. The second is the marginalist approach, developed by John Bates Clark and others, in which workers and other factors  in competitive markets receive the \gls{marginal value-product} of their contribution to production. The two  theories coexist and even mingle in modern economics, but it is the marginalist approach that is at the heard (?? % ***E IS THIS THE RIGHT WORD?) 
of economic teaching. 
% ***E SORRY, IS THIS CHAPTER ABOUT RENT OR THEORIES OF DISTRIUTION??? MAYBE THIS STUFF ABOUT DISTRIBUTION BELONGS EARLIAR? 

Both theories developed in response to the specific social and economic conditions of the periods in which they emerged. Both attempt to explain where the output of society ends up within society. They are, at their heart, stories of who  can or does claim what share of production.  Classical rent theory  emphasized the distribution of the social \gls{surplus}, the part of production  over and above what was needed to reproduce society. Initially this included only land rents, but was later extended Marx to the distribution of profits.  The distribution of these surplus incomes are not explained by the later neoclassical theory. In fact they are assumed to be a transitory phenomenon that disappears as a result of free competitive market entry, even though profits and rents remain a substantial part of national income (20–25 percent)\footnote{Schmitt, Hans Otto, Pen, Jan, Boulding, Kenneth E. and Kleinsorge, Paul Lincoln.

\section{Economic Rent Theory} 

In this thesis, we identify what are essentially classical rents in the urban system and examine their distribution.  
\Gls{rent}, in economic theory is not the amount you pay your landlord every month, nor is it simply a payment for using land or another facility.  For economists, the word normally means the  \gls{surplus} income produced by a scarce factor of production that is created by nature. You pay a high price for housing near the center of a city because nature did not make much land close to the city and having people close to where the jobs are is valuable. The extra you pay to be close to the center is an economic rent. It was not created by the landlord, but it appears as income for the landlord.  Thus the economist's notion overlaps with, but is not identical to the common usage.

\section{Classical theories of production, distribution, and class}

Classical Rent theory origniates with  thinkers such as Richard Cantillon (1680s-1734), Fran\c{c}ois
Quesnay (1694–1774), the marquis de Mirabeau (1715–1789), Anne-Robert-Jacques
Turgot (1727--1781) and Adam Smith (1723-1790), and received its classic statement
in Ricardo (1772-1823). Nearly contemporaneous thinker, Johann Heinrich von Th\"unen (1783-1850) developed a planning model to guide the location of economic activities for an urban-agricultural
society. A version of that model was reinvented in urban geography by William Alonzo.


The canonical presentation of the classical theory of rent \cite{ricardoEssayInfluenceLow1815} was provided  by David Ricardo in 1815 in the context of a primarily agricultural economic system during increasing globalization of trade and  the early stages of the industrial revolution in Northern Europe.\footnote{The Industrial Revolution is usually described as beginning around 1760 and having significantly transformed society by about 1820–1840.} In this period, the study of \gls{political economy} was emerging as a subject of study that focused on understanding trade, wealth, and government. Prior to this, international relationships centred on studies of the military. As colonization changed the relationship between countries and trade became central, the study of \gls{political economy} became more significant. 

For the economists of the very early stage of the industrial revolution  it seemed clear that  all wealth came from the land and that  the tradesmen, professionals, clergy, and aristocrats were all nonproductive.\footnote{The Physiocrats, a school of economists in 18th-century France believed that land is the source of all wealth, that only agricultural labour was productive, and that government policy should not interfere with the operation of natural economic laws. With this framework, they were the first to see labour as the  source of value. Marx would generalize the analysis, and treat industrial labour as generating a surplus as well.} Looking more closely it was they could see that
 only some land produces a surplus of income. Good land produced more market value for the same cost as the poorest land in production. The poorest land in production  just barely justified the cost of production. After paying for  labour and any other costs of production there was no surplus left for the land owner. More fertile land  generated more than the annual costs faced by a landowner. The difference in earnings between the poorest land in production and a more fertile or better located field was the quantity that economists called rent. 
 
 Economic rent and the rent paid by farmers  to use the land were almost interchangable concepts. Landowners would generally prefer not to till the soil or bundle sheaves with their own hands, so they would `rent out' their land. The level of rent charged might not be exactly the economic rent, but in a labour-surplus economy\footnote{Between 1604 and 1914 over 5,200 enclosure Bills were enacted by Parliament which related to just over a fifth of the total area of England, amounting to some 6.8 million acres. From the 1750s enclosure by parliamentary Act became the norm. In Scotland  between 1750 to 1860 the  Highland Clearances  evicted a significant number of tenants in the Scottish Highlands and Islands, mostly in two phases from 1750 to 1860. Enclosures and clearances created a large pool of essentially minimum wage labour that supported industrialization and drove British migrations to the colonies. } landlords would naturally have a great deal of bargaining power, and rents they charge their tenant farmers would tend to be close the entire value of the surplus. Rent as a price and economic rent would have been practically the same.,

 In the classical tradition, rent is the surplus produced by labour using land that is claimed by landowners by virtue of their ownership of the land. Ricardo defines rent strictly in this way, saying ``By rent I always mean the remuneration given to the landlord for the use of the original power of the land.''\cite{ricardoEssayInfluenceLow1815} The key term in that definition is ``the original power of the land.'' The price of the corn would include payment for working the land and for transporting, storing, and  selling the product, but the part that was rent would be a payment for the virtue of the land not of the landlord. The social question that Ricardo answered was, who gets the surplus generated by the land after all other contributors have been paid. This was an approach to understanding the distribution of wealth and explaining the inequality the economists were seeing. 
 
 For Ricardo this theory provided insight into whether Britain should open its doors to corn from the colonies.\footnote{This was the debate over the Corn Laws (1794-1846), a set duties on grain imports into Britain to protect British agriculture from outside competition. In Britain, ``corn'' was the generic name for cereal crops. The full title of Ricardo's essay was was \textit{An Essay on the Influence of a low Price of Corn on the Profits of Stock, showing the Inexpediency of Restrictions on Importation: With Remarks on Mr Malthus' Two Last Publications: "An Inquiry into the Nature and Progress of Rent," and "The Grounds of an Opinion on the Policy of restricting the Importation of Foreign Corn"}.}
His model  explained the distribution of the product of the earth among the “three classes of the community” which is to say, to the owners of land, labour, and capital. 

The term \gls{class} is often used informally as if it refers straightforwardly to people who have different levels of wealth, but when economists talk about classes, they usually mean something slightly different. Economic classes are functionally defined:  by how they participate in production. Owners of labour participate by supplying their labour, for which they are paid a wage. Landowners own the land and receive rents for the use of their land in production. Owners of capital provide funds for starting and operating businesses, for which they receive profits.  There are three classes in this model and three kinds of income.  %It's because the surplus is differently distributed that different have different wealth levels. 

 EXPLAINE SHIFTS  The economic transformations of the period resulted in an increase in overall wealth, although in many cases the living condition of the working class declined. THIS IS WHAT RICAARDO AND OTHER CLASSICAL ECONOMISTS WERE CONCERENED WITH EXPLORING

 %This is what Ricardo developed the concept of rent to explain.  
 % \Gls{class} structure, or how different classes participate in production changes over time as modes of production change. When Ricardo was writing, the economy was still largely reflected feudal social relations in that most land ownership originated in feudal military power. %Even the land of the nobility was divided up into smaller parcels run by knights or vassals. Both of these groups traded military support for land in the local manors. As higher ranking people, knights often presided over an entire manor, while vassals presided only over the land needed to support their families.
 %  (IE DESCRIBE role of labour land, capital under feudalism and how this was changing in that period.) 
 
% The evolution of the mode of production has continued, with human capital rather than land or industrial capital increasing the source of the social surplus. The concept of rent is specifically relate to surplus and enabled Ricardo to first talk about how s is key to distribution within the economy, amongst classes.  Ricardo essentially developed his concept of Rent to explain the dynamics of distribution between classes.

%(It's easy enough to see how this concept would evolve into the two different usages of the term rent. Because it is the profit for the land, which is related to payments for the land. At the time, the feudal ownership structures meant that the value of the land was structured differently. Tenants did not pay to occupy the land the way that people and businesses do today. Rather the value of owning land was reflected in the distribution from production. The term later split to reflect both the way land is currently valued (i.e rent payments to occupy) and the surplus value that was how land was valued in the period of clssical econmics with it's feadul structures. Rent became payment to landlord because under feudalism, the surplus went to the landlords. Thenn the term diverged into the two distinct meanings used colloquially and in a technical context by Economists ) 

% The classical idea of rent and rent % ***E RENT AND RENT??? .... can be illustrated with the story of a carter % call it a distributor/worker?

% % ***E NEED TO CLARIFY WHO OWN WHAT AND HOW LAND IS UCCUPIED UNDER THE ECONOMIC STRUCTURES OF FEUDALISM,
% For simplicity, assume all farmers have the same cost of production, and the carters pay the farmer the farm gate price at the farm and receive the merchant price in town. 

\section{An illustration relating Ricardo and Alonzo} 
Ricardo carefully distinguished the ``intensive'' margin and the ``extensive margin.'' The intensive margin can be seen as the limit to increasing the productivity  of a particular piece of land by applying fertilizer, draining, or paying more workers. The extensive margin is where the most distant land worth cultivating given the cost of transportation. The extensive margin provides a key insight  into modern urban tent theory. 

Figure \ref{fig-rent-ricardo} illustrates Ricardo's theory of the extensive margin using transportation costs to emphasize the similarity between rent in classical theory and in  the Alonzo model. Imagine a town surrounded by potato farms. Imagine there is a man who owns the only cart in the region that can be used to move potatoes. Now imagine that this monopoly carter notices that there is a price for potatoes in town and that farmers are selling potatoes at the farm gate for a lower price. The carter can  make a profit by buying potatoes from farmers near the town, transporting them to the market  and reselling them  at the town price. Whatever remains to remains to him of price gap after subtracting his own labour and vehicle costs is pure profit.  

\begin{figure}[htb]
    \begin{center}
    \input{fig/rent_ricardo.tex}
    \caption{Transport costs, the yellow area, take a share of the profit for vegetables sold in the town}
    \label{fig-rent-ricardo}
    \end{center}
\end{figure}

At a certain distance, the transport costs will eat up all the profit on the trip. That is as far as the carter will go to buy potatoes. That distance is Ricaro's extensive margin. In figure \ref{fig-rent-ricardo}, total transport costs are shown as the yellow area. The area below the yellow triangle is profit for the carter. The carter makes a `profit' on the trip to the farm nearest to town, a declining profit as he travels away from town, and  no profit on any farms beyond this point.\footnote{Note the similarity with Alonzo's urban model, illustrated in Fig \ref{fig-rent-alonzo}.}
If the merchant's price went up, the extensive margin would move farther out, and more land would come into production.\footnote{This simple example assumes that the land is uniformly productive and that there is only one product that can be marketed. Johann Heinrich von Th\"unen, in The Isolated state (Der isolierte Staat (1826)), provide a more complex analysis based on the same principles.} 

Together these two triangles/areas represent the net farm-gate value of the ``produce of the earth'', but only the lower triangle is surplus that can be allocated to the landlord, the carter, the mercheant or the consumeert.\footnote{It was termed the `\textit{produit net}' by the Physiocrats}. In modern supply and demand analysis it would be recognized as `producer surplus', the difference between what a producer gets for a good and what they would be willing to accept.

We have so far illustrated the story using a carter with a monopoly on transportation services. If instead there were a monopoly landowner, and the transportation industry were competitive, the landowner would pay carters their minimum cost and keep all the profits. In this case economists would call the monopoly profits rents.\footnote{In the modern economy, agricultural land rents may be captured by corporations,  either by owning the land or by controlling the supply chain.}  Landlord income in this example is a locational land rent that exists because of the land's proximity to the market.  

The land rent (that was profit) declines with distance from the town,\footnote{% ***E ADD?? This graph is simplified to illustrate the concept.
It also declines for less fertile land, where there is a higher cost of production.} At the extensive margin the land rent falls to zero. Even fertile land beyond the extensive margin will not be farmed because the product cannot be transported to market at a profit. Transportation costs and the price of produce in town determine the size of the  rent triangle and therefore the amount of rent captured by the land-owning class.\footnote{The debate about the  `Corn Laws" that Ricardo  was engaged in was about whether Britain would allow wheat from Canada and Australia to enter, reducing the price of wheat and therefore reducing the income and influence of the land-owning class.} 


%The profit now accrues to the landowner, and we call it land rent. For Ricardo, it was obvious that the land-owning class captured the land rent.

 

%\subsection{A more explicit treatment}
In 1902 Alvin Saunders Johnson \cite{johnsonRentModernEconomic1902} summarized the relationship between rent and surplus in the economic literature as follows: 

\begin{quotation}Of the concrete forms of income that have usually been classed as surplus, the rent of land was the earliest to be defined; and so prominent a position has been given to it that the terms "rent" and "surplus" have come to be used interchangeably.\end{quotation} 


\section{A changing economy brought a change in the theory of distribution}

 As the economy shifted  moved from overwhelmingly  agricultural into the industrialization of the 18$^{th}$  and 19$^{th}$ century, economists shifted their focus from who got the rents to how prices and especially the prices of factors of production were determined. Rent theory was eclipsed by an approach that focused on the markets for the inputs used in industrial production.  Late in the 20$^{th}$ century, the focus shifted again, to the economics of  knowledge, human capital, and how cities generate wealth, a change that plays a part in  our theory of urban rents in Chapter\ref{chapter-growth}. 
 
 The changes have tracked changing social relations. The influence of landowners declined and the power of  industrial capitalists increased throughout the 19$^th$ century. More recently the owners of industrial capital have been eclipsed  by financial capital and, to some extent, by the owners or creators of certain information technologies.

\subsection{Marx}


%Ricardo, agreeing with Malthus, essentially assumes that the wage is  just sufficient to reproduce the labouring class.\footnote{``In the natural advance of society, the wages of labour will have a tendency to fall, as far as they are regulated by supply and demand; for the supply of labourers will continue to increase at the same rate, while the demand for them will increase at a slower rate.''} He then explains the distribution of the fruits of labour on the land among the main classes of the economy.
%***E ADD CONTEXT like:
Karl Marx (1818--1883)) was born three years after Ricardo published his Essay on the price of corn. 
By the time Marx was displaying  his developing interest in economics  at the radical newspaper, Rhineland News, Ricardo had been dead 20 years, the industrial revolution had been underway for almost a century and European economies were largely structured around manufacturing. 

 % ***E MORE ACCURATE TO SAY HE was exploring this because it was what he saw than shifted attention.
 In the manufacturing economy, the owners contribute the machinery, buildings, and even working capital to fund the workers until the product can be sold. % ***E FLESH OUT THIS DESCRIPTION OF THE KEY FEATURES OF TEH MANUFACTURING ECONMY. ALOS SPECIFCAL DEFINE CAPITAL CAN WHY IT MATTERS
 %This contribution must be accumulated from their profits in the preceding cycle of production,  and has to be reinvested once the revenues of the current round have come in and the bills have been paid. Marx actually describes a circuit of capital from its form as money to its form as physical capital. 
As in Ricardo, however, labour is in surplus and capital is scarce. As in Ricardo the scarce factor is owned by a special class - now the capitalists, who are able to appropriate the surplus value. %Like Ricardo,  Marx saw the appropriation of surplus as without moral justification. 

Marx pointed to an additional dynamic feature of  capitalist systems - that productive capital is not fixed as land is, but  expands as surplus is reinvested. This creates an economy that can and, said Marx, must grow, as well as challenges that are created by the capitalists' need to constantly reinvest their growing accumulation of surplus value. It was not until 1867 that  the first volume of Das Kapital,  was published, pulling together 20 years of Marx's analysis of the capitalist economy.  Das Kapital proposes an explanation of the "laws of motion" of the mode of production from its origins to its future by describing the dynamics of the accumulation of capital. With topics such as the growth of wage labour, the transformation of the workplace, capital accumulation, competition, the banking system, the tendency of the rate of profit to fall, land-rents.% ***E EXPLAIN WHAT THIS MEANSAND WHY IT MATTERS TO DISTRIBUTION. HOW IS IT DIIFFERENT OR SIMLAR TO WHAT WAS HAPPENING UNDER FEUDALISM? 
%He famously suggested that the expansion will eventually outrun the expansion of demand and the rate of return will fall, leaving capitalists unwilling to invest. % and creating a crisis. 



We see Marx as firmly part of the Classical tradition and a coibtributor to distributional theory.  Our work, linking urban rents to the dynamics of financial capital has one foot firmly  in the Ricardian and Marxian  tradition. Like Marx and Ricardo we explore how a particular type of surplus is distributed, how that might change, and the effect on society. Like Marx and Ricardo we find that a functional approach to social classes  provides  a useful framework. Where Marx focused on industrial \gls{capital}, however, we focus on capital in a different form, on \gls{financial capital}% ***E SEEMS TO BE A LOT MISSING HERE?

EVEN IF HE DIDN'T USE THE CONCEPT, EXPLAIN HOW IT WOULD RELATE OR FIT (OR NOT FIT) INTO THIS CONCEPT)
 
\subsection{Henry George} 
In 1879, Henry George (1839--1897), an influential American political economist, published his most famous work, Progress and Poverty\cite{georgeProgressPovertyInquiry1973}. It sold millions of copies worldwide. George returned to land rent with a new insight based on the emergence of the capitalist city: the owners of urban land extract surplus in exactly the same way that owners of agricultural land in Ricardo's analysis. ``With the growth of population, land grows in value, and the men who work it must pay more for the privilege.''  Where Marx saw the extravagant productivity of capital as the source of capitalist crises, George saw the extraction of wealth by land speculators as the mechanism that would bring on crises.
  % ***E WHAT DID HE MEAN BY CRISIS? HOW DID HE COME TO BE CONCERNED ABOUT THIS? ALSO SINCE YOU ARE COMPARING WITH MARX's PREDICTIONS ABOUT CRISIS YOU NEED TO EXPLAIN MORE ABOUT MARX'S IDEAS OF CRISIS ABOVE

BEST TO MAKE SURE YOU'VE EXPLAINED THAT GEORGE IS A SOCIALIST, WHAT THAT MEANS, AND THEN, SINCE MARX IS FAMOUSLY BUT CONFUSINGLY INTERCONNECTED WITH SOCIALISM YOU SHOULD EXPLAIN HOW HIS THINK AND (SEPARATELY) THE MOVEMENT NAMED AFTER HIM FIT IN) 
  % # ADD George also presented solutions to ____ 
  
  Since land rent is not created by its owners, George argued that land rent should be seen as a social income - that it could be used to pay for all the needs of the community. The clearest statement of this view is found in Progress and Poverty when he wrote "We must make land common property." The same view was expressed by the Physiocrats who concluded  that ``ground rents'' should be the source of most or all taxes. They defined ground rent as that portion of all rent which is attributable only to the size and location of the parcel. George's analysis the `single tax' movement, which sought to shift all taxation to land  and resource rents.   

   
  In 1977, Joseph Stiglitz, using Alonzo's relatively new urban model, identified the conditions in which Henry George's "single tax" is  the only tax necessary to finance public expenditures.\footnote{Arnott, Richard J.; Joseph E. Stiglitz (November 1979). "Aggregate Land Rents, Expenditure on Public Goods, and Optimal City Size" (PDF). Quarterly Journal of Economics. 93 (4): 471–500. doi:10.2307/1884466. JSTOR 1884466. S2CID 53374401 }   The logic is fairly simple: if the public good increases productivity or the attractiveness of a city, attracting more people or businesses, land rents rise, and investment in the public good should proceed until the marginal cost of the public good is equal to the increase in land rent it brings. The result is now called the `Henry George theorem.'

The classical economists agreed that rents are unearned income. They did not emphasize, as George did, that land rents arise from labour's proximity to urban population and production.\footnote{To be fair, it was not lack of understanding, that the omission reveals, but rather lack of interest in explicitly examining urban land rent from residential or even industrial purposes.}% Ricardo von Thunen, Marx, Cantillon all grasped the notion of proximity to the market as part of the source land rent. The discussions seem to not gone farther than discussions of diffeerential and rents, however.  I just am not aware of them explicitly examining urban land rent for residential or even industrial purposes. 

%The need to be near a market or prodduction center is easily seen by considering a population at the carrying capacity of the land with individuals supporting themselves using purely local resources. There can be no land rent in this case. If a city rises that must be supplied from those still on the land, land close enough to the city will generate land rent. The value of the land is created by proximity to the city.

  \subsection{John Bates Clark and neoclassical distribution theory}
  % # NEED SOME MORE CONTEXT HERE. maybe atart by setting up the PERIOD WE ARE NOW MOVING INTO AND WHAT HAS SHIFTED IN THE ECONOMIC STRUCTURE? 
  \epigraph{THE law of rent has become an obstacle to scientific progress: it has retarded the attainment of a true theory of distribution. Yet it is itself capable of affording such a theory. The principle that has been made to govern the income derived from land actually governs those derived from capital and from labor. }{John Bates Clark \cite{clarkDistributionDeterminedLaw1891}}

  
  Classical theories of distribution showed that ownership of a scarce and non-produced factor, land, was the  basis of rent extraction by the class of landowners. Profits were a bit puzzling for the classical economist because their connection to land rents was not clear. % ***E i DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY PROFITS ARE PUZZLING? WHATS THE QUESTION? eXPLAIN MORE.
  Alfred Marshall (1842--1924)  one of the most influential economists of his time, and one of the founders of the school of neoclassical economics   % ***E WHO IS THIS? DATES? LOCATION?
   pointed out, however, that, in a competitive market with free entry, scarcity profits (i.e., rent for capital) would normally be competed away  as entrepreneurs entered the market in pursuit of those `excess' profits. He used the term `quasi-rents' for these unearned but temporary incomes.\footnote{Alvin Saunders Johnson. Rent in Modern Economic Theory: An Essay in Distribution. AEA 3rd Series, Vol. 3, No. 4 (Nov., 1902), pp. 1-129 (129 pages)} This insight suggests that excess profit (profit over and above the normal rate of return on capital) unimportant in the long run, but left it an important short-run role in attracting existing capital to projects where it is most productive. 

 John Bates Clark (1847--1938) was another of the pioneers of neoclassical theory and was one of inventors of the neoclassical theory of  distribution.  The neoclssical or marginalist approach emphasized that rational economic agents  pay workers according to the value of the marginal product, the amount that the last worker hired added to output. % ***E DEFINE MARGINAL PRODUCT
 The same principle applied to other factors  
 Initially a socialist like George,   % ***E YOU NEED TO HAVE SAID ABOVE GEORGE IS A SOCIALIST OR CUT THIS. 
 by 1986 Clark was praising the dynamical process of competition and opposing the single tax movement George had initiated.  His (1891) ``Distribution as Determined by a Law of Rent,''\cite{clarkDistributionDeterminedLaw1891} argued that, given  competition and homogeneous factors of production labour and capital, the division of the social product will be according to the productivity of the last (or marginal) physical input of units of labour and capital.

 Clark was correct, of course, but, by emphasizing that land and capital were factors of production like labour, he obscured the fact  that it was not the capitalist or the landowner that contributed  to production. It was the socially produced purchasing power or the land they held legal ownership rights over.\footnote{Clark, to be fair, also advanced the concept of social capital as a permanent, ongoing stream of future incomes out of which all productive inputs, including capital goods, are temporarily taken for a charge (interest). Britannica, The Editors of Encyclopaedia. ``John Bates Clark''. Encyclopedia Britannica, https://www.britannica.com/biography/John-Bates-Clark. Accessed 1 March 2023.}  Responding to the ``indictment that hangs over society'' that it involves ``exploiting labour,'' Clark wrote:
    \begin{quotation}
        It is the purpose of this work (his 1899 'Distribution of Wealth) to show that the distribution of the income of society is controlled by a natural law, and that this law, if it worked without friction, would give to every agent of production the amount of wealth which that agent creates. However wages may be adjusted by bargains freely made between individual men (i.e., without labour unions and other "market imperfections", the rates of pay that result from such transactions tend, it is here claimed, to equal that part of the product of industry which is traceable to the labour itself; and however interest (i.e., profit) may be adjusted by similarly free bargaining, it naturally tends to equal the fractional product that is separately traceable to capital. 
  \end{quotation}
  
 In Clark's  perfect competition,% ***E I THINK YOU NEED A BIT MORE ABOUT COMPETITION AS A CONCEPT AND IT'S HISTORY. ITS PRETTY IMPORTANT. ALSO MAYBE REFERENCE ADAM SMITH ? 
 each factor of production—capital and labour—gets its just reward. That conclusion rests on a demanding set of conditions that we can only describe partially in this work. Perfect competition is an ideal type of market structure where all producers and consumers have full and symmetric information: everyone knows the true value of whatever they buy or sell.  This is a condition that may, at best, be satisfied in some markets. There must be large number of producers and consumers competing with one another. In fact the must be large numbers in every market, whether for unskilled labour or specialist surgeon in the Yukon.  There have to be many suppliers of every drug, not to mention sewer services and electricity. there have to be new firms ready to enter the market  for any good  if the incumbents are making excess profits. There cannot be restrictive legislation. in the ideal case there can be no transaction costs - hiring or firing a worker, for example,  is costless,  and there are no delays. The conditions required for a perfectly competitive economy are never met, but many commodity markets and some labour markets may come close enough to let economists treat them as competitive without risking making major errrors. 
 % based on its contribution of  the last unit employed to a company’s profits. 
 A far more realistic description of the world is one of generalized  \gls{imperfect competition}, where the division of the economic pie is based not just on the relative contributions of capital and labour to the bottom line but on their relative scarcity, bargaining power and even political power.  % ***E THIS DOESN'T FEEL FULL EXPLIANED/JUSTIFIED.

 YOU NEED TO EXPLAIN PERFECT COMPETITION AND WHAT IS ACOUNTS FOR, EVIDENCE OF WHAT IT MISSES, ETC, THIS IS JUST A LOT OF ONE BRIEF PARAGRAOH TO COVER. cOULD ALSO JUST REFERENCE PEOPLE WHO HAVE POINTED THIS OUT AS IF THIS IS WHERE ECONOMISTS ARE NOW, AND YOU ARE PICKING UP FROM THERE. 
 
Clark's analysis of income distribution does not contradict the classical view of rents, it simply displaces the analysis to the point where a competitive equilibrium prevails, and shifts attention away from the distribution of land rents. Rents are not earned by the marginal unit of land and therefore the share to land at the margin is zero. 
% ***E i STARTED TO FEEL LOST HERE, LIKE THERE IS A LOT MISSING SO ITS HARD TO FOLLOW. i THINK MAYBE THE SIMPLEST WAY TO FILL THIS SECTION OUT IS GOING TO BE TO TRACE WHAT OTHER ECONOMISTS SAY. LIKE THE NEO-CLASSICASTS SAID THIS THEN OTHERS POINTED OUT THE LIMITATIONS. THEN YOU POSITION YOURESLF AS RESPONDING TO ESTABLISHED ISSUES. 


%Even as Ricardo was writing, the industrial revolution was changing what Marx called the mode production changed. The influence of landowners declined and the owners of more liquid forms of capital became increasingly powerful. Thinkers like Marx and Engles revised and extended  class theory to account for growing power of the capitalists.  By the late nineteenth  century a new school of mathematically inclined economists focused on how competition regulated the distribution of wealth. They shifted the emphasis from ownership of the factors of production to the marginal product of the factors of production in competitive markets. It was eventually shown that the distribution under competition is, if not fair,  is at least efficient in a specific sense.\footnote{The result is known  in economics as the ``First Fundamental Theorem of Welfare Economics.'' The basic idea goes back to Adam Smith and was gradually developed  ver 70 years until Kenneth Arrow and Gérard Debreu (separately, 1951) each gave  a satisfactorily general proof in 1951. In 1986 %their 1986 paper, ``Externalities in Economies with Imperfect Information and Incomplete Markets''
%Bruce Greenwald and Joseph Stiglitz showed that the fundamental welfare theorems do not hold if there are incomplete markets or imperfect information.}
\section{summary}
We have examined the main stages  of rent and distribution theory as  a bridge from classical rent theory to the modern theory of urban rent. On the way we explained the concept of economic rent, how it arises in an agricultural economy, and who gets the rents. We then  tried to explain how rent theory and the classical distribution theory was pushed into the background as neoclassical theorists analysed the  industrial market economy that emerged after the industrial revolution. In the next chapter we introduce 20$^{th}$ century urban models that apply Ricaridian rent theory without exploring the   distributional implications.
