\chapter{Antecedents of Modern Urban Rent Theory} \label{chapter-rent}
In this chapter, we link classical rent theory, neoclassical production theory, neoclassical growth theory, the scaling literature, and urban spatial models. 

%We use the Cobb-Douglas function %, which is used to cross this entire range of literature to illustrate each link and to show how our model is directly connected with this broad collection of linked theories. 
%The Cobb-Douglas function is a production function, expressing the output produced, in terms of inputs such as labour and capital.
%Our model connects to the results in this chapter at four points:

Rent, in economic theory, is different from but related to the common usage meaning a payment for the use of land or another facility.  For economists the word means the economic  surplus generated in production as a result of differences in the quality of some factor of production.  Rent theory was first developed in an agricultural society with market exchange and therefore a market price for agricultural output. Good land produced more market value for the same cost as the poorest land in production. The poorest land in production which just justify the cost of production but generate no surplus for its owner. Better land would generate more than the annual costs faced by a landowner. The difference is is the quantity that economists call rent. Landowners would generally prefer not to till the oil and bundle sheaves with their own hands, so they would `rent out' their land. The level of rent charged might not be exactly the economic rent, but in a labour surplus economy landlords would naturally have a great deal of bargaining power, and rents charged would tend to be close the value of the surplus. 


\section{Classical theories of production and distribution and class}
INTRODUCE RICARDO, CLASSICAL THEORIES - OR RESTRUCTURE AS AN INTRO SENTENCE.
MAYBE REVIEW SOME ALTERNATIVES/FRAME RICARDO
 % \subsection{Ricardo}

 The core social question that Ricardo addressed in his theory of rent \cite{ricardoEssayInfluenceLow1815}
 was who gets the surplus. % The question was pressing because it appeared that landlords were capturing the surplus without contributing to production while many of those who worked that land were very poor. 
Ricardo uses his model to explain the distribution of the product of the earth among the “three classes of the community” which is to say, to the owners of land, labour, and capital. 

In colloquial contexts, class is often used informally as if it refers straightforwardly to people who have different levels of wealth, but when economists talk about classes, they mean something slightly different. Economics classes are functionally defined up by how they participate in production. So labour, or owners of labour, participate by supplying their labour to the production for which they are paid a wage. Landowners own the land and receive rents for the use of their land in production. Owners of Capital provide funds for starting and operating businesses, for which they receive profits.  Ricardo offered a lucid description of  how the socially produced surplus was distributed amongst these classes. %It's because the surplus is differently distributed that that different have different wealth levels. 

 %This is what Ricardo developed the concept of rent to explain.  
 Class structure, or how different classes participate in production changes over time as modes of production change. When Ricardo was writing, the economy was still largely reflected feudal social relations in that most land ownership originated in feudal military power. %Even the land of the nobility was divided up into smaller parcels run by knights or vassals. Both of these groups traded military support for land in the local manors. As higher ranking people, knights often presided over an entire manor, while vassals presided only over the land needed to support their families.
 %  (IE DESCRIBE role of labour land, capital under feudalism and how this was changing in that period.) 
 
The evolution of the mode of production has continued, with human capital rather than land or industrial capital increasing the source of the social surplus. The concept of rent is specifically relate to surplus and enabled Ricardo to first talk about how s is key to distribution within the economy, amongst classes.  Ricardo essentially developed his concept of Rent to explain the dynamics of distribution between classes. 


% #E i LIKE THIS STUFF ABOUT THE PHYSIOCRTAIC SCHOOL. yOU IGHT MORE DIRECTLY FRAME IT IN THE CONTEXT OF A BROADER QUESTION OF VALUE, ROLE IN PRODUCTION AND DISTRIBUTION OF SURPLUS. 
% going back to the Physiocrates. 
% The physiocratic school of economics was the first to see labor as the sole source of value but, for the physiocrats, in the context of the prevalent European rural society of the time, only agricultural labor created a surplus. % actually? % detail for it was ag economy This was the theory? also the french enginneers- detail for start of math/calc-..
%The canonical reference for only agricultural labour mattering? For the definition of rent?

%Ricardo's famous 1815 discussion of capital and  land rent \footnote{ %\href{http://la.utexas.edu/users/hcleaver/368/368RicardoOnCornLaws.html}{An Essay on the Influence of a low Price of Corn on the Profits of Stock}; 
%showing the Inexpediency of Restrictions on Importation: With Remarks on Mr Malthus' Two Last Publications: "An Inquiry into the Nature and Progress of Rent," and "The Grounds of an Opinion on the Policy of restricting the Importation of Foreign Corn"} provides the canonical reference. 
% We haven't introduced this model or what kind of thing it is.

In the classical tradition, rent is the value landowners claimed for the use of their land. Ricardo defines rent strictly in this way, saying ``By rent I always mean the remuneration given to the landlord for the use of the original power of the land\footnote{'' David Ricardo corn laws note 7.}. % explan that ricardo used this as a formal definition of the term. he ....

For Ricardo, and for the classical economics in general, land rent, is a kind of surplus value, that is an amount available after the costs of production have been paid, the term rent came to be used interchangeably with this more general concept in much of the classical work on rent.
%and the term rent has been used in a more general sense to other kinds of surplus value, as well as land rents 
% #E Surplus value is essentially profit. Its the value beyond the cost. SHORT CLASSICAL EXAMPLE. Or, in a modern example, professional sports players' income, above the opportunity cost they could get working at another position, is rent they capture for their skill. 

The classical idea of rent and rent can be illustrated with the story of a carter who picks up vegetables at the farm gate and transports them into town, where he sells them to a  storekeeper. %He pays the farmer at one end of the trip and is paid at the other. 
For simplicity, assume all farmers have the same cost of production, and the carters pay the farmer the farm gate price at the farm and receive the merchant price in town. 

\begin{figure}
    \begin{center}
    \input{fig/rent_ricardo.tex}
    \caption{Transport costs, the yellow area, take a share of the profit for vegetables sold in the town}
    \label{fig-rent-ricardo}
    \end{center}
\end{figure}

In the figure \ref{fig-rent-ricardo}, total transport costs are shown as the yellow area. The area below the yellow triangle is profit for the carter. The carter makes a `profit' on the trip to the farm nearest to town, but at a certain distance, the transport costs will eat up all the profit on the trip. That is as far as the carter will go\footnote{Note the similarity with Alonzo's urban model, illustrated in Fig \ref{fig-rent-alonzo}.}
Ricardo termed this point the `extensive margin', the point at which there is no value for farming for the town. It is the limit for this use, and the profit there is zero. If the price goes up, the extensive margin moves out, and more land comes into production.

The land rent declines with distance from the town,\footnote{It also declines for less fertile land, where there is a higher cost of production.} At the extensive margin the land rent falls to zero. Even fertile land beyond the extensive margin will not be farmed because the product cannot be transported to market at a profit.\footnote{This simple example assumes that the land is uniformly productive and that there is only one product that can be marketed. Johann Heinrich von Th\"unen, in The Isolated state (Der isolierte Staat (1826)), provide a more complex analysis based on the same principles.} Transportation costs and the price of produce in town determine the size of the  rent triangle and therefore the amount of rent captured by the land-owning class.\footnote{The debate about the  `Corn Laws" that Ricardo  was engaged in was about whether Britain would allow wheat form Canada and Australia to enter, reducing the price of wheat and therefore reducing the income and influence of the land-owning class.} 

Together these two triangles/areas represent the ``produce of the earth'', but only the lower triangle is net income\footnote{ Termed the `\textit{produit net}' by the Physiocrats}. In modern supply and demand analysis it would be recognized as `producer surplus', the difference between what a producer gets for a good and what they would be willing to accept.

In Ricardo's case: the land owner delivers the grain to market and receives the merchant price. The profit is what the landowner could claim for the privilege of using the land %The profit now accrues to the landowner, and we call it land rent. For Ricardo, it was obvious that the land-owning class captured the land rent.
\footnote{In the modern economy, agricultural land rents may be captured by corporations,  either by owning the land or by controlling the supply chain.}  Landlord income is a locational land rent that exists because of the land's proximity to the market. 
 

%\subsection{A more explicit treatment}
as Saunders says in 1902, ``Of the concrete forms of income that have usually been classed as surplus, the rent of land was the earliest to be defined; and so prominent a position has been given to it that the terms "rent" and "surplus" have come to be used interchangeably.'' \footnote{Rent in Modern Economic Theory: An Essay in Distribution Author(s): Alvin Saunders Johnson, Publications of the American Economic Association, Nov., 1902, 3rd Series, Vol. 3, No. 4 (Nov., 1902), pp. 1-129}. 

Ricardo expounded a theory of land rent. While he did not write down a formal production function as later neoclassical theorists would, modern neoclassical production theory can be seen as having one of its origins in his work on classical economic theory. % #E Where does this go ... put with explanation of how neo-classicists were influences by Ricardo

While he did not write down a formal production function as later neoclassical theorists would, his theory can be put in the notation neo-classicists used /developed. In modern notation, Ricardo's model can be written: 

\begin{equation} 
Y=F(K,L,N).
\label{eqn-production-ricardo}
\end{equation} 

where $K$ is capital, $L$ is labour and $N$  is the natural resource land.\footnote{This makes it a three factor model of production (cite us/lit) In principle any number of factors can be included.}  
Ricardo does not specify a functional form, but, %like mathematical neoclassical economists, 
he does assume diminishing returns to all factors. The landlord  receives the surplus generated by the land and the rest of the value of production goes to labour and to any capital employed in improving the land. 

The value of the land is the present discounted value of the surplus it generates, that is what it would be worth paying now, to capture the future rents from that land.


\subsection{Marx}


%Ricardo, agreeing with Malthus, essentially assumes that the wage is  just sufficient to reproduce the labouring class.\footnote{``In the natural advance of society, the wages of labour will have a tendency to fall, as far as they are regulated by supply and demand; for the supply of labourers will continue to increase at the same rate, while the demand for them will increase at a slower rate.''} He then explains the distribution of the fruits of labour on the land among the main classes of the economy.

 Marx shifted attention to the manufacturing economy in which the owners contributed the machinery, buildings, and even working capital to fund the workers until the product can be sold. %This contribution must be accumulated from their profits in the preceding cycle of production,  and has to be reinvested once the revenues of the current round have come in and the bills have been paid. Marx actually describes a circuit of capital from its form as money to its form as physical capital. 
As in Ricardo, however, labour is in surplus and capital is scarce. As in Ricardo the scarce factor owned by a special class - now the capitalists, is able to appropriate the is able to capture the surplus value. %Like Ricardo,  Marx saw the appropriation of surplus as without moral justification. 

Marx pointed to a new dynamic in capitalist systems - that productive capital is not fixed as land is, but  expands as surplus is reinvested. %He famously suggested that the expansion will eventually outrun the expansion of demand and the rate of return will fall, leaving capitalists unwilling to invest. % and creating a crisis. 

Marx gives the statement of the dynamic quality of the surplus
- work linking urban rents to the dynamic quality of the surplus in the urban system is in that tradition 
- how does the generative surplus gets distributed, its dynamics/the dynamics of the surplus. 
 
\subsection{Henry George} 


  Henry George, an influential American political economist,\footnote{Progress and Poverty: An Inquiry into the Cause of Industrial Depressions and of Increase of Want with Increase of Wealth: The Remedy (1879) book by social theorist and economist Henry George.}  returned to land rent with a new insight based on the emergence of the capitalist city: ``With the growth of population, land grows in value, and the men who work it must pay more for the privilege.'' For George the owners of urban land extract surplus in exactly the same way that owners of agricultural land in Ricardo's analysis. Where Marx saw the extravagant productivity of capital as the source of capitalist crises, George saw the extraction of wealth by land speculators as the mechanism that would bring on crises.
  
  Since land rent is not created by its owners, George argued that land rent should be seen as a social income - that it could be used to pay for all the needs of the community. The clearest statement of this view is found in Progress and Poverty: "We must make land common property." The same view was expressed by the Physiocrats who concluded  that ``ground rents'' should be the source of most or all taxes. They defined ground rent as that portion of all rent which is attributable only to the size and location of the parcel. George's analysis the `single tax' movement, which sought to shift all taxation to land  and resource rents.   

  
Even as Ricardo was writing, the industrial revolution was changing what Marx called the mode production changed. The influence of landowners declined and the owners of more liquid forms of capital became increasingly powerful. Thinkers like Marx and Engles revised and extended  class theory to account for growing power of the capitalists.  By the late nineteenth  century a new school of mathematically inclined economists focused on how competition regulated the distribution of wealth. They shifted the emphasis from ownership of the factors of production to the marginal product of the factors of production in competitive markets. It was eventually shown that the distribution under competition is, if not fair,  is at least efficient in a specific sense.\footnote{The result is known  in economics as the ``First Fundamental Theorem of Welfare Economics.'' The basic idea goes back to Adam Smith and was gradually developed  ver 70 years until Kenneth Arrow and Gérard Debreu (separately, 1951) each gave  a satisfactorily general proof in 1951. In 1986 %their 1986 paper, ``Externalities in Economies with Imperfect Information and Incomplete Markets''
Bruce Greenwald and Joseph Stiglitz showed that the fundamental welfare theorems do not hold if there are incomplete markets or imperfect information.}

  
  In 1977, Joseph Stiglitz, using Alonzo's realtively new urban model, identified the conditions in which Henry George's "single tax" is  the only tax necessary to finance public expenditures.\footnote{Arnott, Richard J.; Joseph E. Stiglitz (November 1979). "Aggregate Land Rents, Expenditure on Public Goods, and Optimal City Size" (PDF). Quarterly Journal of Economics. 93 (4): 471–500. doi:10.2307/1884466. JSTOR 1884466. S2CID 53374401 }   The logic is fairly simple: if the public good increases productivity or the attractiveness of a city, attracting more people or businesses, land rents rise, and investment in the public good should proceed until the marginal cost of the public good is equal to the increase in land rent it brings. The result is now called the `Henry George theorem.'



The classical economists agreed that rents are unearned income. They did not emphasize, as George did, that land rents arise from labour's proximity to urban population and production.\footnote{To be fair, it was not lack of understanding, that the omission reveals, but rather lack of interest in explicitly examining urban land rent from residential or even industrial purposes.}% Ricardo von Thunen, Marx, Cantillon all grasped the notion of proximity to the market as part of the source land rent. The discussions seem to not gone farther than discussions of diffeerential and rents, however.  I just am not aware of them explicitly examining urban land rent for residential or even industrial purposes. 

%The need to be near a market or prodduction center is easily seen by considering a population at the carrying capacity of the land with individuals supporting themselves using purely local resources. There can be no land rent in this case. If a city rises that must be supplied from those still on the land, land close enough to the city will generate land rent. The value of the land is created by proximity to the city.



%  no separate and comprehensive data are provided on the amounts of land rents and subsoil rents charged and earned, because they are not officially regarded as part of value-added, and consequently are not included in the calculation of GDP (except for the value of productive lease contracts)     https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_and_absolute_ground_rent#Rent_in_macro-economics    \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_and_absolute_ground_rent#Rent_in_macro-economics}{Wikipediat article on differential rent}

Stiglitz is linking the capture of urban rents to productivity.

  \subsection{John Bates Clark and neoclassical distribution theory}
  Classical theories of distribution showed that ownership of a scarce and non-produced factor, land, was the  basis of rent extraction by the class of landowners. Profits were a bit puzzling in this context - Capital also earns its return from scarcity. Marshall pointed out, however, that scarcity profits (i.e., rent) would normally be competed away  as entrepreneurs entered the market in pursuit of those `excess' profits. He used the term `pseudo-rents' for these unearned but temporary incomes.\footnote{Alvin Saunders Johnson. Rent in Modern Economic Theory: An Essay in Distribution. AEA 3rd Series, Vol. 3, No. 4 (Nov., 1902), pp. 1-129 (129 pages)}

 John Bates Clark was one of the pioneers of marginalism and the neoclassical theory of  distribution.  The marginalist approach emphasized the rational decisions of economic agents in allocating their resources would lead them to allocate resources according to the value of the marginal product of the resource in production.  Initially a socialist like George, by 1986 he was praising the dynamical process of competition partly in opposition to the single tax movement George had initiated.  His (1891) ``Distribution as Determined by a Law of Rent,'' argued that, given  competition and homogeneous factors of production labor and capital, the division of the social product will be according to the productivity of the last (or marginal) physical input of units of labor and capital.\footnote{Responding to the "indictment that hangs over society" that it involves "exploiting labor," Clark wrote:

    It is the purpose of this work (his 1899 'Distribution of Wealth) to show that the distribution of the income of society is controlled by a natural law, and that this law, if it worked without friction, would give to every agent of production the amount of wealth which that agent creates. However wages may be adjusted by bargains freely made between individual men (i.e., without labor unions and other "market imperfections", the rates of pay that result from such transactions tend, it is here claimed, to equal that part of the product of industry which is traceable to the labor itself; and however interest (i.e., profit) may be adjusted by similarly free bargaining, it naturally tends to equal the fractional product that is separately traceable to capital.} 

 In Clark's  perfect competition, each factor of production—capital and labor—gets its just reward based on its contribution of  the last unit employed to a company’s profits. A more realistic description of the world is one of imperfect competition, where the division of the economic pie is based not just on the relative contributions of capital and labor to the bottom line but on their relative bargaining power. 
 
Clark's analysis of income distribution does not contradict the classical view of rents, it simply displaces the analysis to the point where a competitive equilibrium prevails, and shifts attention away from the distribution of land rents. Rents are not earned by the marginal unit of land and therefore the share to land at the margin is zero. 



\section{Neoclassical production theory}
The concept of a production function used by increasingly mathematical neoclassical economists and  rapidly developing statistical techniques  naturally led to attempts to identify the precise functional form that would describe the contributions of labour, capital, and income to output.
 
Mathematician Charles Cobb and Economist Paul Douglas came up with a specific and very convenient functional form\footnote{Cobb, C. W.; Douglas, P. H. (1928). "A Theory of Production"  American Economic Review. 18 (Supplement): 139–165. JSTOR 1811556. Retrieved 26 September 2016. The function had apparently previously been used by Knut Wicksell, Philip Wicksteed, and L\'eon Walras.} that captured much of what economists were talking about. The function is just a generalized arithmetic mean:
 
 \[Y=AK^\alpha L^\beta\]
 where $A$ is a constant scale factor, commonly called `Total Factor Productivity. This function becomes the workhorse of neoclassical growth theory in the second half  of the 20th century. Our urban model is a direct heir of those developments.

%The Cobb Douglas function has several convenient features. One is that the sum of the coefficents tells us the degree of returns to scale. If $\alpha+\beta = 1$, we have constant returns to scale,

%Another is that the coefficients of the factors, $\alpha$  and $\beta$ turn out to be the elasticities of output with respect to capital and labour respectively as well as the income share of the factor. These made it relatively easy for economists to combine national data on labour and capital stocks or income with output to test the model.

The Cobb–Douglas form was developed and almost immediately tested against statistical evidence in the USA by Cobb and Douglas between 1927–1947. It was  their widely circulated empirical work seems to have permanently associated this simple function with Cobb and Douglas for economists.

\section{Classical vs neoclassical production theory}

Ricardo's analysis of land  can be thought of as focusing only on land:

\begin{equation} 
Y=F(L,N).
\label{eqn-production-ricardo-2}
\end{equation} 
where $K$ is capital, $L$ is labour and $N$  is the natural resource  land.

Most modern neoclassical treatments of production have the same basic structure of the production function, but they simplify by omitting land and emphasized capital:
\begin{equation} 
Y=F(K,L).
\label{eqn-production}
\end{equation}  
which makes sense for a number of reasons. The economy has shifted from agriculture to industry and the4 focus of economic theory has shifted to manufacturing processes.
%Leaving land out of the model makes sense for a variety of reasons. 
Furthermore, according to the Ricardian theory, rent is a surplus above cost. It does not, therefore enter into price. Land is a fixed factor for society as a whole that is not consumed in  the process of production.  Neoclassical treatments of production focus price determination based on the cost of the last unit used, the marginal  unit of input, while rents are generated on all of the inframarginal units, those units used earlier, which are more productive. The marginal unit of land generates no rents. In neoclassical analysis, the rents disappeared from view for this reason. This difference is at the heart of the distinction between classical and neoclassical economic theory. 

%John B. Davis. Ricardo's Theory of Profit and the Third Edition of the \textit{Principles}. Journal of the History of Economic Thought, 15, Spring 1993. °1993 by the History of Economic Society.
%``Questions arise, however, when one turns to exchange between a sector paying rent and one not.'' The Principles tells us that as cultivation is extended and exchange increases, profits fall while rents increase. 

Leaving land out, however, creates a problem in  the neoclassical growth theories we will examine below. Under the assumption of perfectly competitive goods and factors markets as well as marginal productivity pricing of capital and labor, neoclassical growth requires technical change to be generated outside the model because there are no resources left to innovate if both factors of production are paid their marginal product.\footnote{This follows from Euler’s theorem: if, for a given level of technology $\bar A$ output Y is produced according to a \textbf{constant returns to scale} and twice continuously differentiable function of capital and labor $F(K, L, \bar A)$, Euler’s theorem implies that $F_K K + F_L L=Y$, where $F_i$ is the marginal product of factor $i$. Payments to  capital and labor take up the entire national product and no resources are left to finance the production of technology-improving innovations. are paid their marginal product.} 
If, however, land is reintroduced, as it must be in an urban model, there must be rents and there is therefore a surplus available for innovation.
\footnote{An alternative and common approach is to assume imperfect competition, which may be based on increasing returns to scale, in which case firms with market power may achieve a surplus. ``Although seldom modeled outside the monopolistic competition framework, market incompleteness and imperfect competition are central to the new growth theories'' (Gilles Duranton, Growth and imperfect competition on factor markets: Increasing returns and distribution, European Economic Review, 44-2, 2000, 255-280), Similarly, Sjak Smulders and Theo van de Klundert conclude that ``Growth is higher in a more concentrated market provided that market power of firms is not too high,'' (Imperfect competition, concentration and growth with firm-specific R \& D, European Economic Review, 39-1, 1995,139-160).}

Classical rent re-appears in neoclassical theory as `economic rent' (``a money payment made for a factor of production that is over and above the minimum payment to keep it in its present use,'')  as quasi-or pseudo-rents (non-equilibrium rents that will be competed away in a competitive equilibrium according to Marshall.\footnote{see Lewis Cecil 4 Rent Under the Assumption of Exhaustibility, Quarterly Journal of Economics, May, 1914, Vol. 28, No. 3 (May, 1914), pp. 466-489}),  as consumer  and producer surplus in supply and demand analysis,  as rent profiles or Pseudo-rent curves in urban theory, as a major concern on resource economics, and the theory of rent-seeking. Economic rent is a surplus insofar as its payment is not necessary to ensure a supply of a particular factor of production. 


% HOUSING RENT IN THE NATIONAL ACCOUNTS
%   Owner-occupied housing is included in Peersonal Consumption Expenditure because the National Income and Producgt Accounts (NIPAs) treat the owner-occupant as if it were a rental business, or in other words, a landlord renting to him or herself. That is, BEA imputes a value for the services of owner-occupied housing (space rent) based on the rents charged for similar tenant-occupied housing, and this value is included in GDP as part of personal consumption expenditures. This imputation is necessary in order for GDP to be invariant when housing units shift between tenant occupancy and owner occupancy.


%Ricardo  clearly understood and used the concept of diminishing marginal product. This shows in his use of the terms ``extensive margin'' and ``intensive margin'' to explain the income of the landowner. He focussed on the difference between the cost of production on a unit of land and the revenue generated. The landlord would rent out all the land which generated at least enough to pay all the costs. Anything in excess of the costs could be charged as land rent to a tenant farmer.



%Clearly in his model there are two basic productive factors, land and labour. The landlord  receives the surplus generated by the land and the rest of the value of production goes to labour. 
Recent urban models, on the other hand, tend to ignore the production process and consider the locational implications of land and transportation costs on the location of people. Wealth distribution is often ignored.
