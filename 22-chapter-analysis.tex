\section{Class}
We use the concept of \gls{class}  to explore the consequences  of financialization in the housing market. The term class was  used  by classical and Marxist economists to refer to patterns in the ownership of productive assets.\footnote{ Erik Olin Wright summarizes the approach common to classical and Marxist analysts:  ``The fundamental contrast in capitalist societies, for example, is between owners of means of production and owners of labor power, since `owning' is a description of rights and powers with respect to a resource deployed in `production'\thinspace'' \cite{wrightAlternativeFoundationsClass2002}.} Those who had only their labour to sell were \gls{working class}. Those who lived off the rents from the land they owned were \glspl{landowner}. Those who captured the surplus from industrial production because they owned the capital stock were capitalists, and those who lived off the the income from property or money lent were \glspl{rentier}.\footnote{The term rentier is used variously. It is applied to people living off the income from already acquired wealth, and applies, for example to pensioners.  In `rentier capitalism' it is a noun meaning: a business model in which ownership of key types of scarce assets-such as land, intellectual property, natural resources, or digital platforms-is all-important and dominated by a few unfathomably wealthy companies and individuals called rentiers.}

This basic classification is too simple, of course. To describe a real society more fully, it has to be completed with a variety of sub-classes and intermediate classes. Table~\ref{table-classes} illustrates one approach based on Roemer's  \textit{A general theory of exploitation and class} \cite{roemerGeneralTheoryExploitation1982}. Variations in assets generate distinct professions, identities and alliances far more complex than a simpler version would suggest. The model allows for mobility between classes of the sort we suggest is occurring as a result of financialization of the housing market.

Workers, for example, who sell not just their labour, but also their talents and/or the services of their education will earn more as a rule and live better. Talents may include native skill in carpentry or coding, or beauty. Education includes the long apprenticeship of talented artists and  trades training as well as postsecondary education, management experience, or experience on wall street. It is worth noting that education is achieved by investment and is a capital asset, while talent is a gift of nature like land. 

The middle classes are especially complex because of the variety of assets individuals may own. The traditional shop owner, for example, often described as a member of the \gls{petite bourgeoisie}, may work in his own a shop and with his equipment and enjoy a relatively comfortable income, but still  need to apply his own labour. The professional classes have skills as a result of their investments in learning their profession. the market value of their human capital may be increased by professional organizations that restrict entry to the profession, and augmented by social capital.  Despite the similarity between the craft trades and the professional trades, the latter generally have greater social status. Consideration of social  further complicates discussions of class.

One of our goals is  to show how financialization of the housing market drives change in the class mix within cities using this asset-based understanding of class.





we could also think of location as among them





\section{Investment amplifies the problem of financialization}
\section{financialization amplifies the problem of housing shortages }

\begin{enumerate}
    \item to model set a low alternative $i$ and then put a dial on the amount of K in any period (this is friction)
    \item Vary individual costs of capital - the function that raises the rate for the poorer buyers can be made steeper.
    \item How do we make $\dot p$ more volatile - this feeds into developer decisions
\end{enumerate}

This will accelerate tenantization.

\subsubsection{holding property for later development}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item We need a density function. Redevelopment is increasing density. Unit size (land per unit) is constrained by a utility function  (but only for newcomers, I think.) 
    \item with a density choice increasing density can be delayed.
    \item you could even set a hard boundary on the city and just explore density. 
    \item We need a way to increase population pressure. (maybe just amplify the wage
\end{enumerate}
If it's not a supply problem
Leaning into rental removes a key piece of how we've build the model


Would get pieces held off the model.
get units held off the market.


Model to hold the developer.. 
Need a desnity function, go to a different density..
look to see when it's better to wait to invest in increasing density.

\section{Financialization: Implications of the bidding rule}

There are some implications of the financialization mechanism:
\begin{enumerate}
\item A large $m$ magnifies the return. (The downpayment is smaller as a fraction of the price, increasing the investor's leverage). 
Given the  common rule that mortgage payments cannot exceed some fraction of disposable income, the wealthy will be able to borrow larger amounts and at lower interest rates than the less wealthy. At any distance from the centre they will be able to make a higher bid.

\item A lower mortgage interest rate increases the return by lowering interest payments. The cost of capital is known to differ for rich and poor.  The wealthy can generally borrow  at lower interest rates than the less wealthy. 

\item A lower discount rate $\delta$ reduces the subjective rate of return.  Poverty in assets and cash liquidity constraints are correlated with higher rates of time preference  \cite{carvalhoPovertyTimePreference2010}\cite{holdenPovertyMarketImperfections1998}. If agents discount at their borrowing rate, wealthier agents may have a lower subjective rate of time preference and therefore value properties more highly. 

\item Higher expected price appreciation increases the attractiveness of an investment. Financial corporations and the wealthy are likely to have better price forecasts than  the occasional home buyer.

\item Higher rents make the unit more profitable. Higher expected  rents may result from expecting greater price appreciation  leading to raising rents for tenants. Lower discount rates may give future rent increases greater present value.

\item Lower maintenance costs increase profits. There may be scale economies in the maintenance  of rented housing. 

\item Lower tax rates decrease holding costs and increase the value of the investment. There may be opportunities to shelter income with land held for investment (speculative) purposes. Tax treatment of income and capital gains as well as interest deductibility may also provide advantyages for institutional buyers and investors.%\footnote{Case and Schiller \cite{LOST_CaseandSchiller} observe that (source?) `` ... increases in real per capita income all are positively related to excess returns or price changes over the subsequent year.''} 
\end{enumerate}

Some  of these conditions (1-3) hold generally for wealthier actors. Others (4-7) may be available only to institutional investors.  Financial corporations in particular may have advantages relative to individual investors, making it  reasonable to expect that financial corporations increasingly dominate urban land 
markets.\footnote{Fr\'ed\'erick Demers \cite{demersModellingForecastingHousing2005} found that the response of housing investment to interest rates has become more pronounced over time. This suggests a rising share of financial investors relative to buyers focused on housing services. Case and Schiller \cite{caseThereBubbleHousing2003} observe that `` ... increases in real per capita income all are positively related to excess returns or price changes over the subsequent year.''}  

Since interest rates are lower for those with higher wealth, the analysis implies, consistent with the empirical evidence, that net returns for investment are increasing with wealth. Large wealth holders will get higher expected and actual rates of return on land than those with lower wealth holdings. Managers of large pools of capital will have an even greater   advantage. Overall, Equation~\ref{eqn-bid-price} implies  sales generally go to the richest participant.
 
%  \footnote{Case and Schiller \cite{LOST_CaseandSchiller} observe that (source?) 
%  `` ... increases in real per capita income all are positively related to excess returns or price changes over the subsequent year.''} 

% The conclusion that we draw from the analysis above is that  financialization of urban housing benefits a rentier class of urban landholders. There is evidence that it benefits a globally distributed class of rentiers.  



\section{Financialization as system change} \label{section-system}
We established that, at least in theory,  financial institutions and the wealthy are likely to own increasing shares of the housing stock. the theoretical conclusions is consistent with what has already happened in the Canadian Housing market. Recent data from Statistics Canada \cite{fontaineResidentialRealEstate2023} suggests people who own more than one property in Ontario make up more than 25\% of buyers in the province. (The proportion of investors among owners varied from 20.2\% in Ontario to 31.5\% in Nova Scotia.)
Just under one in five properties overall was used as an investment.
In Ontario 41.9\% of condominium apartments are investment properties \cite{statisticscanadaBuyRentHousing2022}.

The immediate social implications are fairly obvious. As Statistics Canada points out, these trends might limit the number of properties available to buyers who intend to use it as a primary place of residence  \cite{fontaineResidentialRealEstate2023}. Statistics Canada reports that latest census release, two-thirds of Canadians owned a home in 2021, down from a peak of 69 per cent a decade earlier. The decline is was higher for younger members of the population. 

When the homeownership rate goes down, the rental rate goes up. The 2021 Canadian Housing Survey reported that the number of renter households increased  at over twice the pace of owner households, pushing down the homeownership rate in Canada. If the trends continue, Urban Canada will gradually change from a society dominated by homeowners to a predominantly tenant society. Since wealthier buyers are advantaged in the market, the younger and poorer parts of the community will be increasingly excluded from ownership. Financialization will increase income and asset inequality in cities.

Combined with rising housing prices the effect will be to squeeze lower-wage households closer to what we have termed to subsistence level and make it harder for low-wage workers to live in the city. The city requires low-wage workers for many of the services, so labour shortages are a possibility. Labour shortages will squeeze some activities out of the city and are likely to reduce productivity. Labour shortages may push up wages, but in rental markets, landlords can capture much of any increase in wages. 

The incentive structure in our model was derived purely from the point of view of an individual investor. Examination shows that investment incentives favour the wealthy and institutional buyers, but that does not necessarily imply that the process of financialization will drive social transformations. Individual choices are at most  a link in the chain. Modelling  allows us to identify which parameters are most influential. 

A question that is especially important is whether the process of financialization and tenentization our micro model suggests is reversible:  high levels of home ownership we have seen throughout the 20$^{th}$ century, as Purdy \cite{purdyPropertyOwningDemocracyHome1993} suggests, may be ``a transitory phenomenon of the 20th century.''

We need to understand the economics of financialization.
% \section{Literature on theory and evidence} % PROVIDE EVIDENCE 	mention theories?
There is substantial evidence that the financialization of urban housing is underway in Canadian cities..

Two questions arise when we observe the growing participation of global capital in the urban housing system: 
\begin{enumerate}
\item How far will the financialization of urban land go? 
\item That are the implications for the urban economy and the welfare of the urban population? 
\end{enumerate}

We can demonstrate that in the absence of policy interventions, differential access to finance capital ensures that capital owners acquire an increasing share of urban land % over time
and therefore capture the growing land rents from urban productivity growth. 

With this insight, growing wealth inequality emerges within a simple, widely accepted model of the urban land market. In the limit, urban residents are tenants, and new residents without capital no longer receive any of the increases in rents arising from the growing productivity of the city. 

%The first question, therefore, is reduced to which capital holders will increase their share of urban land and whether there is any reason to expect the process of financialization process to stop or reverse itself.

% \section{The incentives for financialization}
%Instead, drawing on the ideas of Jane Jacobs, Lucas proposes the city as the unit of analysis. Lucas, Robert (1990), ``Why Doesn't Capital Flow from Rich to Poor Countries?,'' American Economic Review Papers and Proceedings v. 80, no. 2 (May) pp. 92-96.

MOVE The mortgage share and interest rate are functions of the agents wealth %Both the  share of the price  that can be mortgaged, $m$, and the interest rate and the interest rate paid, $r$, are functions of the agent's wealth.

\section{Distributional consequences of the analysis}
The analysis in this dissertation makes clear that in addition to distributional consequences, the housing crisis has productivity impacts. Specifically, the analysis in this thesis concludes that, given the ongoing financialization of the housing market:

\begin{enumerate}
\item the financial system will eventually extract all net urban land rents through investment in urban property
\item housing accessibility will become increasingly challenging for disadvantaged groups
\item housing will be largely eliminated as a saving mechanism and asset fr middle income Canadians,  resulting in a systematic decline in the `middle class'
\item that the quality of urban life will decline
\item the economic growth and development of cities is threatened by this financialization
\end{enumerate}

\label{fig-municipal-costs}
\end{figure}
 

ANALYSIS SECTION - PRODUCTIVITY AND SERVICING - DENSITY RELATIONSHIPS For example, two stylized facts should be noticed. The first is that the marginal cost of servicing generally  rises with the distance from the centre. Figure illustrates the general form of servicing costs, but not  the relative scales of rent and servicing costs. When this observation is combined with the \gls{Henry George Theorem} the conclusion is that the optimal size of the city  is at  $d^{**}$, where marginal service cost intersects with the marginal increase in total urban rent.  Walter Christaller, 1933

ANALYSIS SECTION - PRODUCTIVITY AND TAX - The second stylized fact is that property taxes, which are generally  fixed as a share of property value, decline as the distance from the centre increases. Figure~\ref{fig-municipal-costs} illustrates the general form of tax liabilities, although it does not  accurately represent their relationship to rent or  servicing costs. This implies that in many or most urban situations the residents at the outer edges pay less than the average amount in property tax per unit of land, but cost  the community budget more than the average amount. In essence, the central city subsidizes the suburbs. (see Perverse Cities \ref{blaisPerverseCitiesHidden2011}). This arrangement is both economically inefficient and unfair, but it has been built into the fiscal structure of cities largely as a result of automobile-based urban growth. It is likely that this fiscal misallocation saps some of the potential productivity growth of cities. Property taxation reduces the market value of properties, but it also funds services and amenities that increase the value of properties. 

Both servicing and taxation effects are more variable and than the simple model suggests.  One conclusion urban theorists draw based on variants of the Alonzo model is that because property owners in the low-density urban margin are subsidized,  the subsidy is likely to create serious fiscal problems for municipalities in the long-term and result in serious inefficiency in land use.

Political opposition is essentially rent seeking.

\section{Differential transportation costs}
 Urbanists agree that before the railroad and the automobile, the extent of a city was roughly determined by how far a person could walk in about an hour. The time and effort cost of transportation determined the size of cities. 
 
 It also affected the distribution of the classes within the city. When everyone walked, the  wealthy may have valued their time more than the poor. In terms of the model, the willingness to pay of the rich would higher higher near the core than than the willingness (or ability) to pay of  the poor, but would descend more rapidly with distance

 If the technology suddenly provides the rich with commuter trains or automobiles and more attractive sites at the edge of the city, the orange line could drop enough  and become much flatter leading in a flight of the rich to the suburbs, as appears to have happened in many American cities.

The transportation cost revolution brought about by the first street cars and later automobiles made much larger cities possible.  The average walking pace is 2.5 to 4 mph, and new transportation technologies raise this rate by a factor of between five and ten, increasing potential urban area by between twenty-five and one hundred times.   

% THIS IS INTERSTING K.  morgages: Effect of a finbancial instument on urban form!!  suburban flight, second half of the century

%Electric trolleys drew upon manufacturing technology that appeared only in the eighteen eighties and at first only in America. 

%As with other transportation revolutions, institutional as well as technological revolutions were necessary for the interurban phenomenon to succeed.  One such institutional revolution was the creation of the home mortgage in the eighteen eighties.  Another was the development of the public utility, a regulated monopoly, in the earlier twentieth. century.\footnote{https://faculty.washington.edu/jbs/itrans/charge20.htm} The automotive revolution was as important in its way as the coming of the railroads.

%The automobile in time established even more powerful synergies, but they weren't present at the beginning.  Roads suitable for automobiles scarcely existed though new methods of paving utilizing macadam or concrete had recently been invented.  Furthermore, there was no good model in place for road construction.   Unlike the case with either light or heavy rail systems, the vehicles and the road itself were not part of the same corporate entity.       

%Once automotive ownership assumed certain proportions toward the close of the teens of the century, the automobile began to transform the landscape of America in an even more fundamental way than the streetcars had. 

%From the second decade of the twentieth century, the automobile in America has been linked with suburban flight, and when the growth of suburbs reached a crescendo early in the second half of the century, automobile ownership became the norm. 

% Because exurbs are already numerous and growing more so, they place considerable pressure on the Body Politic to ensure that fuel prices remain low, for if prices rise beyond a certain point the exurbanites will be forced to sell out, probably at ruinously low returns because few will choose to live in isolated areas without affordable transportation.  True, exurbs could conceivably be served by public transportation, but only at enormous cost per rider because the population densities are so low in the areas where they are located....

% That places the vast suburb dwelling public at risk and the exurbanites most of all.

Initially, rents fell at the centre and rose outside of the original city limits. Lower rents and cheaper suburban housing attract more workers, so that central rents and the land values they support  rise to the original levels and then, because the rising population makes the city more productive, beyond the original level. 

It  also affected social structure and left indelible marks on the form of cities developing at the time and after. In North America, with large amounts of land, it generated massive urban sprawl, but also made land available for a growing `middle class' of homeowners. This homeowning middle class became the dominant social formation in North 
American society. 

Ultimately the urban expansion generated congestion and rising transportation cost that began to limit urban growth, put upward pressure on  housing costs including transportation, and therefore downward pressure on middle-class effective incomes. Rising congestion costs steepen the rent profile and  reduce the net productivity of cities. Although the process is not a focus of this thesis it represents a relatively simple extension for later work.

\subsection{Class structure} \label{section-class-structure}
At the stage illustrated on the right  in Figure~\ref{fig-rent-driving},  %(Alonzo city suburbanized with owner occupiers) 
as a result of rapidly rising productivity, falling transportation costs, and large amounts of land with relatively low productivity, a new urban social system has emerged with a land-owning working class. 

The term \gls{class} is often used informally as if it refers straightforwardly to people who have different levels of wealth, but when economists talk about classes, they usually mean something slightly different. Economic classes are functionally defined:  by how they participate in production. Owners of labour participate by supplying their labour, for which they are paid a wage. Landowners own the land and receive rents for the use of their land in production. Owners of capital provide funds for starting and operating businesses, for which they receive profits.  There are three classes in this model and three kinds of income.  %It's because the surplus is differently distributed that different have different wealth levels. 

This emergence of a land owning working class is a recent phenomenon, and perhaps primarily a North American one. We are concerned in this thesis with whether may also be a passing stage.

America's economic transformation in the early 1800s was linked to dramatic changes in transportation networks. The construction of roads, canals, and railroads led to the expansion of markets, facilitated the movement of peoples, and altered the physical landscape. The later commuter transportation revolution further transformed cities and class structures.

\section{Development and financialization}

Financialization is not expansion of the housing stock, it is transfer of ownership. It is a process orthogonal to development.

% - it can lead to efforts to extract more rents by displacing people to invest in a shift in built form.
There are a number of potential links with the development process.
