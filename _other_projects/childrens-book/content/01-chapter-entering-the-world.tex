\chapter{Jackie's Dream}
\lettrine{W}{e saw a castle on the horizon} and when we looked again it was pink and purple and blue.\footnote{Jackie's dream last night. She told me it by Facetime over breakfast 2024-01-19, 11:27 AM Fri.} The three of us, Wyatt Jackie and I 
 we were going to get ice cream at the pool though I thought it was closed

Then we went for a walk and saw far in the distance a castle and when we looked closer it was pink and purple and blue.  And when we looked again we saw a bad guy in it. 
Then we looked again and it was tiny and right in front of us

It fell over 
And then a police officer came to carry it to prison. 
I said `It's not my fault' and he smiled at me. 
He put it in a wagon he was pulling and began walking off. 

But it swung open on a hinge at the center and the bad guy climbed out and out of the wagon and ran down a leafy path. 

Jackie leapt into my arms so the police office wouldn't take her away.
Wyatt ran after the bad guy towards the path.

It said `Wyatt!' he exclaimed looking back at us.
