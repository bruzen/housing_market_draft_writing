\section{initial notes}


‘We project that future disruption of ecological assemblages as a result of climate change will be abrupt, because within any given ecological assemblage the exposure of most species to climate conditions beyond their realized niche limits occurs almost simultaneously. Under a high-emissions scenario (representative concentration pathway, or RCP 8.5), such abrupt exposure events begin before 2030.’ Again, these RCPs are very conservative.”—Dr. Guy McPherson
