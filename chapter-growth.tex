The Cobb-Douglas form for representing production technology captured  important regularities in the cross-sectional national data,\footnote{ A 2021 meta-analysis of 3186 estimates concluded that "the weight of evidence accumulated in the empirical literature emphatically rejects the Cobb-Douglas specification."Gechert, Havranek, Irsova, Kolcunova (2021), "Measuring capital-labor substitution: The importance of method choices and publication bias", Review of Economic Dynamics, doi:10.1016/j.red.2021.05.003, S2CID 236400765. More sophisticated models  such as the CES and translog functions have been developed  since.} 
but the estimates soon showed a systematic bias with time series. Essentially the value of the $A$ seemed to rise over time. Something that was not captured in the initial model  contributed to productivity over time: 
 \[Y=A(t)K^\alpha L^\beta\]


 \section{The Solow-Swann growth model}
In 1956 Robert Solow\footnote{A Contribution to the Theory of Economic Growth,  Robert M. Solow, The Quarterly Journal of Economics, Vol. 70, No. 1 (Feb., 1956), pp. 65-94. Stable URL: http://www.jstor.org/stable/1884513} provided a possible explanation, opening the field for a further series of refinements in an enterprise that became known as ``growth theory.''
\footnote{Solow and his contemporary, Edward F. Denison in his 1961 monograph, \textit{The Sources of Economic Growth in the United States}, were attempting to account for the main features of U.S. economic growth, not to provide a theory of economic development.}%   R.E. Lucas, Jr., On the mechanics of economic development.}

Solow argued ``As a result of exogenous population growth the labor force increases at a constant relative rate n,'' so
  \[L(t)= L_0e^{nt}\] 
If we insert this term into the production function 
 \begin{eqnarray}
 Y&=cK^\alpha (L_0e^{nt})^\beta\\
    &=c(e^{nt})^{\beta}K^\alpha L^\beta\\
  %  &=A(t)K^\alpha L^{1-\alpha} \label{Eq:Solow}
 \end{eqnarray}
we see that $A$ becomes
 \[A(t)=c(e^{nt})^\beta\]
and we have a version of the time-dependent term needed to  allow the model to track the data better. More than half  of the cross-country variation in income can be explained by per capita saving and population growth alone.



%???       It is no surprise that adding a variable allowed the model to track the data better. More  interesting is that the appearance of term $1-\alpha}$ in the scale factor $A$ suggests a spillover effect of human capital on the productivity of other factors.\footnote{Breton, T. R. (2013). "Were Mankiw, Romer, and Weil Right? A Reconciliation of the Micro and Macro Effects of Schooling on Income" (PDF). Macroeconomic Dynamics. 17 (5): 1023–1054. doi:10.1017/S1365100511000824. hdl:10784/578. S2CID 154355849.}  

%The estimated model explained 78\% of the variation in income across countries.
% the estimates of $\beta$ implied that\textbf{ human capital's external effects on national income are greater than its direct effect on workers' salaries.}%(\url{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solow\%E2\%80\%93Swan_model)}.  Theodore Breton provided an insight that reconciled the large effect of human capital from schooling in the Mankiw, Romer, and Weil model with the smaller effect of schooling on workers' salaries. He demonstrated that the mathematical properties of the model include significant external effects between the factors of production because human capital and physical capital are multiplicative factors of production.[20] The external effect of human capital on the productivity of physical capital is evident in the marginal product of physical capital:
%    \[ MPK={\frac {\partial Y}{\partial K}}=\frac {\alpha A^{1-\alpha }(H/L)^{\beta }}{(K/L)^{1-\alpha} }\]


Solow's 1956 paper stimulated a vast literature in the 1960s, exploring many variations on the original one-sector structure. % (per Lucas on mechanics), See Burmeister and Dobell (1970) for an excellent introduction and survey. 
In these models, saving and population growth rates determine the growth trend of the economy. An important  contribution of the neoclassical framework stems from its ability to quantify the effects of various influences on growth. The estimated influences of saving and population growth with the Solow model appear too large, however.%Ludcas on the mechanics of ec dev
\footnote{In 1992, N. Gregory Mankiw, David Romer %(not to be confused with Paul M. Romer, mentioned above and below) 
and David N. Weil analyzed Solow’s Model in their paper “Contribution to the Empirics of Economic Growth” and  showed that %Solow correctly predicts the directions of saving and population growth, but not the orders of magnitude. Furthermore they pointed out that, 
if the model was augmented by including human capital $H$, it would fit the data even better.   (Mankiw et al. 1992). Their equation was, in our notation   \[Y=A(t)K^\alpha H^\gamma L^\beta\label{Eq:Mankiw}\] They assume $\alpha+\gamma<1$ which implies decreasing returns to all capital.} 
To understand the relation between saving, population growth, and income, it was necessary to go beyond the textbook Solow model.%, which assumed  diminishing returns to capital and labor separately and constant returns to both factors jointly, 


To understand the subsequent growth theories based on human capital, or what is sometimes called `effective labour' it is helpful to notice that Solo's formulation is unchanged if we substitute `labour times  skill' for $L$ in his model. both components of `labour times  skill,' or effective labour grow over time. The apparent effect of increasing labour supply could be, in fact, the combined effect of rising labour supply and increasing labour skill. Later studies would disentangle the two.

In 1988, Robert E. Lucas would observe that ``It seems to be universally agreed that the model ... is not a theory of economic development.   \dots while it is not exactly wrong to describe these differences (in GDP  growth rates) by an exogenous, exponential term like A(t) neither is it useful to do so. We want a formalism that leads us to think about individual decisions to acquire knowledge, and about the consequences of these decisions for productivity.''\footnote{Lucas,  Robert E. On the Mechanics of Economic Development. Journal of Monetary Economics 22, 1988 3-42} 

% NOTE for  K   
%If we replace the labor-capital technology of the Solow model with a land-labor technology of the same form, and treat labor as the mobile factor and land as the immobile, we obtain a model that predicts exactly the immigration flows that occurred and for exactly the reason - factor price differentials - that motivated these historical flows



One of the predictions of the neoclassical growth model, even  when the concept of capital includes human capital, is that without  continuing improvements in technology, per capita income growth eventually ceases on the equilibrium path. 
By treating technological change as exogenous, neoclassical growth theory could not focus on the fundamental forces which determine long-run growth of nations. Theorists got around the problem to some extent by assuming that technological progress occurs in an exogenous manner. 

The models that followed, starting with Arrow's 1962 model of `learning by doing', introduce human capital and learning in a variety of ways. This is a central insight. Human capital may enter  as a stock that accumulates in the firm or the sector (Arrow (1962), Levhari (1966), and Sheshinski (1967b)) (proxied by aggregate prior capital investment.)
%(Levhari-Sheshinski)as  the experience of workers, the number of units previously produced, 
or the amount of innovation in other firms and sectors. % ( King and Robson )


Identifying  plausible ways that human capital might affect development was relatively easy. Measurement of human capital presents great practical difficulties. To extract the implications of a particular path, it was also necessary to construct a tractable model, analyze its dynamic properties, and find proxy data to test the initial hypothesis.   A series of papers did exactly that.

Kenneth Arrow (1962) gave a dynamic interpretation to increasing returns by emphasizing 'Learning by Doing'. This was an early attempt to render technological progress endogenous in growth models by making the productivity of a given firm an increasing function of cumulative aggregate investment for the industry. Productivity rises with cumulative firm output.


 It is important to note that these models all open the possibility that governments can  promote growth through investment in education, research, technology transfer, and incentives for firms.

\subsection{Endogenous (neoclassical) growth models}
A new wave of research on economic growth was stimulated by Romer (1986) and Lucas (1988). In their models, returns to scale are external to single economic agents and internal to a sector or larger parts of the economy. We apply the same insight to urban models to incorporate the growth-enhancing effect of agglomeration. 

%Basically, two branches have developed, pioneered by Romer (1990) and Lucas (1988). CHECK THESE SOURCES

Paul Romer's 1986  model\footnote{ based on his 1983 thesis} describes `learning by investment'. In this model, the increase in total factor productivity depends on firms’ learning, or investment in knowledge accumulation through research, rather than output. He models the incentives for the production of knowledge explicitly. The production function  can be written

\[Y = A(R^T)R^\gamma  K^\alpha L^\beta) \]
Where $R(\equiv R_i)$ is the research effort of the specific firm, and $R^T=\sum_iR_i$ is the total research in the industry,  $R$ is a choice variable for the firm, which is to say, it decides how much to invest in research. 

A notable feature of this model is the spillover effect on all other firms of the firm's investment through the Total Factor Productivity term,  $A(R^T)$. \textbf{This is the logic of our own model of agglomeration effects in the city.}



In 1988 Lucas also argued that technical progress is not exogenous, but endogenous. He proposed a model that is very close technically to the similar models of Arrow (1962), Uzawa (1965)and Romer (1986). Following our notation, 
\[ Y = A(H^e) K^\alpha (HeL)^\beta \] 
where $H^e$ is the economy's average level of skill (human capital).  Improvements in skill in any firm  increase overall productivity.  $HeL$  can be understood as the `effective' labour force of the firm. It is a product of $L$, size of the workforce. $H$, is the skill level of the firm's workers, and $e$, is the fraction of work time spent working. $1-e$ is the fraction of worker time  spent in training. The  special feature is that $e$ is a choice variable for the firm.\footnote{It could as easily be a choice variable for workers in the aggregate model.} More time training increase $H$ but reduces $e$, so the firm faces a tradeoff.


The difference between Romer and Lucas style theories is that endogenous growth in the theory of Romer is caused by accumulating technology (or knowledge), while in Lucas it is through training (accumulating human capital)\footnote{Although it is not of direct concern for our work, it is useful to recognize that much of the emphasis in these models is on finding the conditions that can explain the observed long term  and growth over and above that driven by exogenous population or technology growth. }

%THIS NEXT PARAGRAPH A SIMPLE COPY. FIND SOURCE

Again we see the  internal effects of human capital, where the individual worker undergoing training becomes more productive, and an external or `spillover' effect which increases the productivity of the economy. 
The evidence supports the existence of significant learning spillovers in a variety of industries. Using survey data, Mansfield (1985) found that information about new processes and products in ten industries surveyed had widely diffused within a year. Spillovers have also been found in econometric studies: Irwin and Klenow (1994) find them in semiconductors; Thornton and Thompson (2001) in wartime shipbuilding; Lieberman (1989) in chemicals; Foster and Rosenzweig (1995) in the adoption of high-yielding seed varieties; and Conley and Udry (2007) in the adoption of best practices by Ghanaian pineapple farmers. 

\textbf{ NOTE for Kirsten:  Neoclassical  growth theory predicts that growth rates of different countries with same rates of saving and population growth and with access to the same technology will converge. In  endogenous growth theory there is no force leading to the convergence of growth rates of different countries with closed economies. If the logic extends to urban systems as we believe it does, growth rates of cities will also diverge.}

In all of these models, the unit of analysis is the nation,  or the firm. Lucas has suggested,\footnote{Journal of Monetary Economics 22 (1988) 3-42.  ON THE MECHANICS OF ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT*
Robert E. LUCAS, Jr., University of Chicago, Chicago, 1L 60637, USA}
however, that `` a national economy is a completely arbitrary unit to consider.'' and that ``we know from ordinary experience that there are group interactions that are central to individual productivity and that involve groups larger than the immediate family and smaller than the human race as a whole.''  


As a result, ``following very closely the lead of Jane Jacobs, whose remarkable book The Economy of Cities (1969)'', Lucas goes on to suggest `` that the 'force' we need to postulate account for the central role of cities in economic life is of exactly the same character as the 'external human capital' I have postulated as a force to account for certain features of aggregative development.''  He concludes that if this is so, ``\textbf{\dots land rents should provide an indirect measure of this force (emphasis  ours)}, in much the same way that schooling-induced earnings differentials provide a measure of the productive effects of internal human capital. ''

This insight, which parallels ours, has not been adequately explored, in our view.  Allowing Lucas to expand on his observation about Jabobs, 


\begin{quotation}
    Her emphasis on the role of cities in economic growth stems from the observation that a city, economically, is like the nucleus of an atom: If we postulate only the usual list of economic forces, cities should fly apart. \textbf{The theory of production contains nothing to hold a city together.} (empahsis ours) A city is simply a collection of factors of production - capital, people, and land - and land is always far cheaper outside cities than inside. Why don't capital and people move outside, combining themselves with cheaper land and thereby increasing profits? Of course, people like to live near shopping and shops need to be located near their customers, but circular considerations of this kind explain only shopping centers, not cities. Cities are centered on wholesale trade and primary producers, and a theory that accounts for their existence has to explain why these producers are apparently choosing high rather than low-cost modes of operation.
\end{quotation}

This observation provides a natural link to the scaling literature on cities.


\section{Cities and the scaling literature}
Neoclassical production theory does not address the spatial structure of the economy. Why are there cities? What drives the historic transition from land-based agricultural society to a much denser urban society? 

In The Economy of Cities (1969) Jane Jacobs argued that when people come together in cities they make each other more productive. This is in essence, a theory of urban agglomeration that could be written
\begin{equation}\label{eq:LtoN}
Y = A(t) K(t)^\alpha L^\beta 
\end{equation}
where $L$ stands for the size of the urban labour force. Since urban labour force and population are closely correlated, the familiar model is  observationally equivalent to
\begin{equation}\label{eq:N2}
Y = A(t)N^{\alpha+\beta}
\end{equation}
\footnote{ To see why, let  $cN$ be labour employed by capital in firms, where $N$ represents the urban population and  assume a constant capital-labor ratio $1/d$. Replace $K$ with $dcN$
\[Y = A(t) (dcN)^\alpha (cN)^\beta) \]
But  $dc^\alpha$ and $c^\beta$  are simply  multiplicative constants that can be incorporated into the scale factor $A$, so  the function becomes 
\[Y = A(d, c,\alpha, \beta, t)N^{\alpha+\beta}\]
}

A model of a national economy that uses the number of urban dwellers would track as well using the number employed. As countries develop, cities account for an ever-increasing share of  national populations and an ever-increasing share of national income.  This is  even more likely when we recall that the principle insights coming out of neoclassical growth theory point to human capital and education as the mystery factor in growth and cities are where the most skilled workers concentrate and where the strongest educational institutions tend to be. The mysterious contribution to growth pursued in the previous sections might  actually be a consequence of urbanization.

We have conventional diminishing returns to scale  if we impose the standard neoclassical assumption, 
$\alpha +\beta <1 $.\footnote{
The required condition is that 
$Y(\delta K,\delta L< \delta Y(K,L)$. 
In the function that we use to illustrate the models, 
$Y(\delta K,\delta L)= \delta^{\alpha +\beta}Y < Y(K,L)$.} 
That leaves us with a question: what do we need for Equation~\ref{eq:N1} to represent Jacobs' observation?  

The answer lies in making the synergies that Jacobs point to explicit: we require $N$ to generate a spillover effect similar to those  identified in neoclassical growth theory. There are three obvious generic ways to introduce such a term: $N$ can augment $A$, $K$, or $L$, 

NEEDS ALIGNMENT
  
\[Y = A*N^\gamma K^\alpha N^\beta= AK^\alpha N^{\beta+\gamma}\]
\[Y = A (N^\gamma* K)^\alpha  N^\beta= AK^\alpha N^{\beta+\gamma^\alpha}\]
\[Y = A K^\alpha (N^\gamma* N)^\beta= AK^\alpha N^{\beta+\gamma}\]

Each of these yields a form of
\[Y = AN^\psi\]
where $\psi> \alpha +\beta$ and may be greater than one. 
The question now is whether we can find estimates of $\psi$.

The evidence we need comes from another field. Complex systems theory is concerned with identifying and characterizing common design elements that are observed across diverse natural, technological and social complex systems. It focuses on general principles  identified in complex systems across many fields such as biology, physiology, ecology, stock markets, multi-user online  networks, data systems, human settlements.and urban systems.

Scaling analysis is a tool developed in complex systems science to investigate how extensive properties of the system vary with a system's size.  or scale.  In urban science, there are now many studies of  the relationships between urban population size and  features like urban economic output,  area, growth, traffic congestion costs, and even social  indicators like crime and homicide rates. Our particular interest is in studies linking city population  and  economic output. 

The model used is familiar. Omitting subscripts for time, $t$ and city, $i$, \footnote{Bettancourt (2021) writes the model \[Y_i = Y_0(t)N_i(t)^\beta e^{\xi(t)}\]. }
\[Y = Y_0e^{n(t)}N^\beta\]
where $Y_0$ is an initial value. Notice that this looks exactly like the form that we saw in the 
Solow-Swan model with the transform from $K^\alpha L^\beta$ to $N$.  The interpretation is different because the model is used to estimate the parameter $\beta$ and $e^{n(t)}$ is described  as an error term of the form commonly used in estimating multiplicative time-series models. As a result estimates of $\beta$  can be used as estimates  of $\psi$.

\vspace{2cm}
The empirical scale factor is a feature of  a static urban system, but, as we have seen it is essentially a growth model. If the population rises, output must rise more than proportionately, but if the population responds to the share of output, the population should then rise. This is a 

Much of growth theory was concerned with identifying the dynamics of such systems and in particular with the implications for the growth of incomes. The growth models, however, were not spatial models, and therefore abstracted from land rents And distribution. They have nothing to say about the distribution of city product and the effect that distribution might have on growth.\footnote{Early models employ a macroeconomic savings function which usually has a fixed savings rate, with savings being reinvested in productive capital. } 

\vspace{2cm}


\section{Does this belong here? Model stages}

Our model has three stages: first, a production function, modeling how urban regions generate wealth,  second a spatial model of an urban housing market, and third, an analysis of distribution within that model 

In this section, we introduce the basic structure of the production side and connect it to the literature on urban scaling. The basic scaling result at the level of the city allows us to incorporate the effect of agglomeration in a standard  circular-city model in a simple way, avoiding the need to explicitly model labour markets and firms.\footnote{Explicitly modeling labour markets and firms is a natural way to specify the model more completely, but it would require introducing many ancillary assumptions and selecting among alternative models of agglomeration, when when we want to focus on distributional and growth-affecting features of the system.}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item to introduce  the productive nature of cities we basically assume the presence of scaling. Given  that the scaling literature gives us an estimate of the economies of scale in a production function this allows us to simplify the model and focus on the features of the urban system rather than on fully specifying a production system. In our model, the city  exhibits economies of scale with respect to population directly. 

     \item  productivity of the city to generates an economic value for land that gives rise to rents

    \item  the rental value of land structures the spatial structure of the city

    \item we exploit the rent model and transport costs to get  distributional consequences
\end{enumerate}

\section{Equilibrium city size  in terms of scale factor} 
At this point we can briefly describe how the discussion of this chapter relates to our overall modelling. There are four basic equations in the model. The first two link output and the wage to population. 






\subsubsection{population and output}
Equation one, following Bettencourt (p65) says that  urban productivity is proportional to population via a scale factor: 
\[Y\propto N^{\beta}\]  
\footnote{ In contemporary US cities productivity increases by about 11\% with each doubling of their population.  Urban Scaling and the Production Function for Cities Lobo J, Bettencourt LMA, Strumsky D, West GB (2013) PLOS ONE 8(3): e58407. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0058407 },
and has both theoretical and empirical support. 

% \begin{tabular}{ll}
% $Y$ is &Aggregate urban output, or GDP \\
% %$\alpha$ & agricultural wage\\
% $G$ is&a `prefactor', possibly time dependent, an initial population\\
%  $N$ is& city population\\
% $ \beta$  is& scale factor, the elasticity of output with respect to city population .\\
% \end{tabular}\vspace{.5cm}

This is illustrated below for $\beta=1.13$.

    \end{center}
\end{figure}
 
 This figure illustrates a worry for me - the \textbf{average income} - {a proxy for the wage?) rises with $N$ but not more rapidly than transportation costs.
 
\subsubsection{Output and wage}
We need a combination of classical and neoclassical distribution theory.

City output is divided among the classes of society. Neoclassical theory suggests wages are allocated according to marginal product and classical theory suggests rents according to the pattern of ownership.

Equation one, in effect determines a wage, (Given the observed values for the scaling coefficients for total wages and labor, $bW < 1.15$ and $bL < 1$, )  although there are many possible distributional specifications and many possible labour market and firm structures. Bettencourt provides two  estimates,  1.11 and 1.35, for the scale factor for urban personal income in the Brazil and South Africa respectively.\footnote{A more recent  study supports the Bettancourt results for Chiin Wu W, Zhao H, Tan Q, Gao P. An Urban Scaling Estimation Method in a Heterogeneity Variance Perspective. Entropy (Basel). 2019 Mar 28;21(4):337. doi: 10.3390/e21040337. PMID: 33267051; PMCID: PMC7514821.} 

\subsubsection{Wage and city size}
The third determines the extent of the city. This comes form the Alonzo model discussed in chapter XXXXA.

A simple case is the circular city with uniform transportation cost, $t$. \[r^*= \frac{w}{t}\]% A more complex model might have density depend on location, for example, in the continous circular cityt\,
If transportation costs vary by  distance we might have something like this constraint on extent\[w=\int_0^{d*} t(d)dt.\]

This approach imposes an equilibrium condition on the model. It is unnecessary working with a citation of known extent and density. The analytic approach is easily extended to variable transportation cost, although at the expense of additional computational complexity.

\subsubsection{City extent and population}
Equation  four  closes the model by linking the extent of the city to the population. A simple case is the circular city with uniform population $d$, where $d$ is density per unit area and $r^*$ is the radius of the city: \[P=d\pi r^{*2}\] 
More generally, density might vary with for example, the distance $r$ from the centre of the city:
\[P=\pi \int_{0}^{r*}d(r)\,dr\] In a computational model a table of densities would provide the link.

  Rent-seeking is the act of growing one's existing wealth without creating new wealth by manipulating the social or political environment. Rent-seeking activities have negative effects on the rest of society. They result in reduced economic efficiency through misallocation of resources, reduced wealth creation, lost government revenue, heightened income inequality,
