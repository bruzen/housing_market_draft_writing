\chapter[Parameters]{Parameter Values} \label{appendix-paremeters}

\textbf{New citation and draft of how to use it.}

Capozza et al \cite{capozzaFundamentalsLandPrices1989} show that land price has four additive components: the value of agricultural land rent, the cost of conversion, the value of accessibility, and the value of expected future rent increases. 

The first two can be treated as a constant. The third and fourth two are the focus of this thesis. The value of accessibility in our model is determined by the urban wage premium, which rests on the productivity of the city. Expected future rent increases are driven by increases in the value of accessibility, which is to say, the rising productivity of the city. Productivity rises in our model due to pure agglomeration effects. Our concern is with what happens to the city and its people when financial capital captures the growing value generated by the agglomeration process.  


\section{Setting up the model}
It is convenient to set up the model using initial values that are close to equilibrium values It is also helpful if the values are somewhat `realistic' to develop an intuitive feeling for whether model behaviour is plausible. 
% We have to do some initial calculations because we want to start near the equilibrium value. 

There are several parameter values we must set for the model. There are also endogenous values we compute in order to initialize the model. These values are listed in sections \ref{sec-param-values-list}, and \ref{sec-init-value-list} respectively. The following sections discuss where those numbers come from. % These are summarized in TABLE.

In the lower left of Figure~\ref{fig:Agglomeration-surplus}  we illustrate a single firm with decreasing returns to scale operating at its optimal scale, $n$. The thick diagonal line represents the effect of  increasing the number of firms operating at the optimal scale. It is the constant returns (CRS) line. If congestion effects from bringing a large number of firms together were dominant, a city would exhibit decreasing returns to  scale,  $N$, and agglomeration would not occur. Research indicates that cities exhibit increasing returns to scale, illustrated by the upper line, which shows the city generating and increasing surplus as it grows a the CRS case

\end{figure}

We need to distinguish the parameters of production functions for rural and urban firms and for the city as a whole. We assume that  rural and  urban firms use the same Cobb-Douglas technology $Y=A_FK^{\alpha_F}L^{\beta_F}$. The difference is that the urban firm enjoy a  multiplicative agglomeration externality $N^\gamma$ which we assume is negligible for the rural firm and omit. $Y=A_FN^\gamma  K^{\alpha_F}L^{\beta_F}$.

In addition, there is an aggregate production function for the city from the scaling literature which we write $Y=AN^\beta$. We omit the subscript $C$  the parameters of the aggregate production function

\subsection{Parameter values} \label{sec-param-values}

\begin{description}
\item  [subsistence wage] $\psi$ = \$40,000. %  that is within range of reasonable subsistance wage in Canada for after-tax income. Try also lower values.

\item  [initial wage premium ratio], $p_0\in\{0.04,0.30\}$ from various sources. The percentage by which urban wages exceed rural wages (empirical range)

\item  [initial extent of the city*] $f_0$ to get the number of lots ($f_0^2$) where it's worthwhile to work. This is different from the width of the grid. We use $f_0$ and $\omega_)$ to calculate $c$. **** Alternatively we could set  $c$. Suburban area is  = $f^2$ 

\item  [workforce of a standard rural firm] $n=100$. This is also the initial value for urban firms. The urban firm value will evolve over time: $n_{Ut}$ 

\item [price of output] = 1. (If you wanted to be able to vary this, you would put a price parameter in front the % of marginal products. 
\gls{marginal product of labour}. %pMPL)

\item [firm cost of capital] $r = 0.05$ or 5\%.

\item [seed population] $P_0=0$. % An initial population at the center that anchors the population. % We need to seed it with an initial core urban Cities aren't unseeded.  Zero initially. , but it is something to adjust to get reasonable behaviour

\item  [density]  workers per lot, Combined with the city extent, $f$, this gives us suburban population. VARIABLE FOR DENSITY. A high value reduces the computation time by reducing the number of cells, but it means we have a representative agent in  each cell. Notice we can set density individually for each cell in the grid, so density is really a vector variable.% Also explore a density of 1 with a higher seed population.

\item [worker share of urban agglomeration surplus] $\lambda=\beta_F$ (Workers are getting the same share of the surplus and they do of output with no agglomeration effects.)


\item  [$\mathbf{\alpha_F}$ ] =  0.18 (typically 0.2 in macro models, but empirically values are lower, and lower values leave room for agglomeration effects),  for a single firm with a production function $Y_{Fi}=A_F K_i^{\alpha_F }L^{\beta_F}_i$ (empirical range =)\footnote{``In the U.S. from 1948-1995 the capital elasticity bounds were 0.18-0.33, and rose to 0.21-0.39 in 1995-2018.'' Dietrich Vollrath, (2021) The Elasticity of Aggregate Output with Respect to Capital and Labor. Hwe akso found that the capital elasticity in the private business sector is 0.09-0.28 from 1948-1995, and 0.16-0.33 from 1995-2018, and it is lower if intellectual capital is excluded.}

\item  [$\mathbf{\beta_F}$ ]  = 0.72 (typically 0.8 in macro models, but empirically values are lower, and lower values leave room for agglomeration effects) elasticity of output with respect to labour for a single firm. (empirical)\footnote{Douglas  obtained a result for the exponent of labour of 0.75—which was subsequently confirmed by the National Bureau of Economic Research to be 0.741} 

\item  [$\mathbf{\beta}$ =1.12] Urban agglomeration coefficient for the city: elasticity of URBAN output with respect to population (empirical)

\item [$z$] Scaling adjustment for calculating the number of new entrants 

\end{description}



\subsection{Initial values for endogenous variables} \label{sec-init-value-list}

There are also  initial  values that we calculate based on the parameters above. These are not fixed: Some, like "Output for a typical rural firm", are simply intermediate variables used in further calculations.% that have to be chosen because they are used in calculating other values are:

\begin{description}
\item  [initial wage premium ]  \[\omega_0=p\psi\]

\item [equilibrium cost of transportation] $c = 2\omega/f$. Constant

\item[initial labour force for  urban firms] initially try values similar to the rural firm size and vary it $n_R=n$. *****%may have implicagtions later for the notation

\item [baseline population] $N_0=density * f_0 * f_0 + P_0$.

\item[labour cost for typical rural firm] $L_R = n_R*\psi$. This is expressed as a money quantity: e.g., 100 workers*\$40,000/worker.  

% \item[Initial labour cost for typical urban firm] ]  $L_U = n_R(\psi+\omega_0)$.

\item[number of urban firms] $F_0=\frac{N_0}{n_0}$.****

\item[output for typical rural firm]  
\[Y_R=\frac{n_R*\psi}{\beta_F}\]
This is a constant for any initial values. Derived from the marginal productivity condition. See item~\ref{item-paramlist-firm-level} in the orange  block. The numerical calculation is done  for a firm with 100 workers and a marginal product of labour of $\psi$. I get \$20 million for those values. 


\item[initial output for an urban firm] 
\[Y_0^U=N^\gamma Y^R\]  
Taking the marginal product with respect to $n$, we get a useful fact that will allow us to tie down $\gamma$
\[Y_{U,0}=\frac{n*(\psi+\omega)}{\beta_F}\]

{\color{red}
\item[elasticity of urban output with respect to population.] $\gamma$. Combining the two marginal productivity conditions, 
\begin{align}
\frac{n\psi}{\beta_F}  &= \frac{n(\psi+\omega)}{N^\gamma \beta_F}  \\
N^\gamma &= (1+\omega)/\psi)\\
\gamma &= \frac{log(1+p)}{log(N)}
\end{align}
}

\item[capital for typical rural firm]. (Derived from the marginal productivity condition.)
\[K_F=  \frac{\alpha_F Y_F }{r}\]
This is also a constant.
 
\item[initial capital for an urban firm]. (Derived from the marginal productivity condition.)
\[K_{U,0}=  \frac{\alpha_F Y_F }{r}\]
This is also a constant.

\item[scale factor A for typical  firm] 
\[A_F= \frac{Y_R}{K_R^{\alpha_F} L_R^{\beta_F}}\]
This is a constant used for both rural and urban production functions. The explicit function is a bit  messy but the numeric value is easily computed because we have $L_r=n_R\psi$, and have calculated $Y_F$, and  $K_F$


\item[equilibrium wage premium] = $\omega_0 = (wage\_premium\_ratio) * \psi = p*\psi $

\item[equilibrium wage] = $\omega_t +\psi $

\item [agglomeration surplus $\mathcal{S}$] We define the agglomeration surplus as the difference between the output produced by  the city with population N and a set of $N/n$ standardized rural firms each with a labour force $n$ and with a total workforce of $N$. 
\[\mathcal{S_0}=A^U N^\beta-F_0Y_R \] 
This is illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig:Agglomeration-surplus}

The surplus can also be expressed in terms of the wage premium:
\[\mathcal{S_0}=N\omega_0/\lambda=\frac{N\omega_0}{\beta_F}\] 


\item[urban scale coefficient $A$] Combining the two expressions for $\mathcal{S}$
\begin{align*}
 AN^\beta-\frac{N}{n}Y_F    &=\frac{N\omega}{\beta_F}\\ 
 AN^\beta   &=\frac{N\omega}{\beta_F} + \frac{N}{n}Y_F \\
 AN^\beta   &=\frac{N\omega}{\beta_F} + \frac{N}{n}\frac{n*\psi}{\beta_F}\\
AN^{\beta-1}   &=\frac{\omega+\psi}{\beta_F}\\ 
  A&=\frac{\omega+\psi}{\beta_FN^{\beta-1}}
\end{align*}
\textbf{NOTE: A is scale independent and all of the population agglomeration effect appears in $N^\gamma$.}

\textbf{NOTE: With the initial values calculated in this section $\omega$ is consistent with $N_0$.as a result, population should not grow. }

% \item[initial-wage-offer] Initial urban wage offer, The wage  is the marginal product of labour for initialization of the model. 

%  \item[Urban firms' initial marginal product of labour]
% \[MPL_{t} = \frac{\beta_{F}N_0^\gamma Y_{R}}{ n}\]   
\end{description}

\subsection{Evolving endogenous variables}

Variables that evolve over time have to be recalculated at each step. 
\begin{itemize}
    \item Variables have to have a time subscript. 
    \item We also have to distinguish the urban firm from the basic rural firm.  Only the urban firm changes its behaviour.  I use a subscript $_U$. 
    \item I omit the subscript for $n_t$ because only the urban firm changes its workforce size.
\end{itemize}

\begin{description}
\item[number of firms] $F_{t}=\frac{N_{t-1}}{n^{target}_{t-1}}$. Firm formation uses current variables to set number of firms for the next period 
(\color{red}
\item[actual Urban firms' employment] 
$n_t^{actual}= \frac{N_t}{F_t} $. Available workers are divided among existing firms.   

\item[actual Urban firms' capital] Should be based on planned output rather than the labour available in the period, so we begin with \[\omega_{t}+\psi = \frac{\beta_{F}Y^{target}_{t-1}}{n_{t-1}^{target}}\]
which gives us 


\item[urban firms' actual marginal product of labour]
\[MPL_{t} = \frac{\beta_{F}Y^{actual}_{U,t}}{n_t^{actual}}\] \noindent Firms observe their output, Yt and find  MPL= that they want to set equal to the wage. Al the values have been determined in the previous  and $n^{actual}_t$ is calculated using values from the  previous period, we get

\item[urban firms' output] by solving the above for Y
\[Y_{U,t}=  n_t^{actual}\frac{\omega+\psi}{\beta_{F}} \] 
This is used to calculate target employment.
% \item[(urban firms' capital)] (May not be needed)
% \[ K_{U,t}= \frac{\alpha}{\beta} \frac{n_{t-1}(\omega_{t-1}+\phi)}{r}\]

\item[urban firms' target employment for $t+1$] Firms examine their own output and marginal product of labour, all calculated with values determined in the previous period. Following the  optimality rule, MPL=wage and MPK-r, they compute a target value for $n$ and $K$
\[ n^{target}_{t+1}= \frac{\beta Y_{t}}{\omega_t + \phi} \]



\item[Aggregate Urban labour demand of existing firms $N_{F,t+1}^{target}$] 

\[N_{F,t+1}^{target} = \frac{n^{target}_{t+1}}{n^{actual}_{t}} N_t\].   
This makes sense because Y is produced with the previous year's target assuming  $\gamma$ was constant but  $\gamma$ could have risen. (This should be the same result as  multiplying $n^{target}_{t+1} \times F_{t} $)



\item[New entrant labour demand,  $n\Delta F$] Firms enter when $MPL > wage$, which with existing technology permits profit making. New firms would set the same target employment as existing firms. 
\[n\Delta F =Z\frac{MPL_t-\omega_t -\psi}{\omega_t +\psi}F n^{target}_{t+1}\]
This makes sense because the number of entrants as a fraction of the existing number of entrants should be larger when the profit margin is larger. New firms would set the same target employment as existing firms and 

\item[Aggregate Urban labour demand of existing firms $N_{Total,t+1}^{target}$] 
\[N_{Total,t+1}^{target}= N_{F,t+1}^{target}+n\Delta F\]

\item[number of firms] 
\[F_{t+1}=\frac{N_{Total,t+1}^{target}}{n^{target}_{F,t+1}}\] 
This adjusts over time, keeping the firm labour force near the optimal level. 

\item[Wage adjustment factor] This is the fraction by which desired labour exceeds actual labour
\[\nu_t =\frac{N^{target}_{t+1}-N_{t}}{N_{t}}\]
or 
\[\nu_t =\frac{n^{target}_{t+1}-n_{t}}{n_{t}}\]

\item[Wage adjustment] We use $N-f^2 *density$ and $F=2\omega/c$. So $\die{N}{omega}=4fden/c$ and \[\Delta \omega=  \frac{c}{4fden}\Delta N = [\frac{c}{4fden}(N_{Total,t+1}^{target}-N_t)\]
Where This is the wage adjustment that would attract the desired number of new workers.

Should the adjustment occur in a single period?

It may be useful to but in an adjustment factor $adj \le 1$.
\[\omega_{t+1}=\nu_t \omega_{t} + adj \Delta_t  \omega\]

\section{Explaining relationships that constrain parameters }

Explaining relationships that constrain parameters if the model is near an equilibrium path: 

CONSTRAINTS DIRECTLY FROM RESEARCH ON THE URBAN WAGE PREMIUM
\begin{enumerate}
     \item  Empirically the urban wage premium  $\omega$ is some fraction $p$ of the non-urban wage $\psi$.   This implies that if we set the subsistence wage, The urban wage is $(1+p)\psi$ and $\omega= p*\Psi$.


CONSTRAINTS DIRECTLY FROM THE CORE URBAN MODEL
    \item From the urban model, the extent of the city is determined by transportation costs:   $\omega =c*width$.  Only two of these parameters can be set independently.

    \item From the urban model population is determined by area and density   $N=density* f^2$. we assume the city is symmetric  and we assume plots  of land are identical, so  - $area=f^2$. If there is a core (or seed) population it must be added.  
   
    \item From the urban model the urban wage is the subsistence wage plus the urban wage premium $\omega+\psi$ 

CONSTRAINTS DIRECTLY FROM THE AGGLOMERATION/SCALE MODEL
    \item From the scale literature the value of aggregate output is $Y=AN^\beta$ for the city. This establishes a relationship between urban GDP and population. We initially make population equal to the workforce. 

    \item Empirically, $\beta \approx 1.13$


CONSTRAINTS DIRECTLY FROM THE NEOCLASSICAL THEORY OF THE FIRM
    \item From neoclassical theory of the firm the competitive equilibrium wage is the  marginal product of labour in the firm.      This should hold both in the urban and rural economies. This implies       $ MPL^R=\psi$  and $ MPL^U=\omega+\psi $.

    Using a Cobb-Douglas production function, we can get explicit expressions for the marginal productivities of labour and capital. 

CONSTRAINTS DIRECTLY FROM THE COBB-DOUGLAS PRODUCTION FUNCTION
The firm production functions are 
\begin{align}
Y_R  &= \quad  A_FK^{\alpha_F}L^{\beta_F}\\
Y_{R, )} &= N^\gamma A_FK^{\alpha_F}L^{\beta_F}
\end{align}
We start with firm labour forces  being equal at $n$.

\item $\sum_X \alpha_X \le 1$ is required for diminishing returns to scale. 



 %      \item From the theory of the firm with a general production function, an increase in the price of one-factor  results in increasing factor proportions for other factors.  

\begin{quotation} \color{orange}
\subsubsection{Firm level production}   
We want the marginal product of labour in the rural economy at the firm level to be at least close to \$40,000.  We can create a generic rural firm and then consider an urban firm with agglomeration effects to get the parameters we need. 

Firm employment $L$ is small relative to  urban employment {N}. Assume it is 100 workers. 

Assume that the rural production function is 
\[ Y_{iF}^R=A_{F} K^{\alpha_F} L_F^{\beta_F} \]
where  $L_F=n*\psi$, $\alpha_F=0.18 $,  and $\beta_F=0.76$.notice that the MPL is the partial derivative with respect to $n$ and not L. 
\footnote{These values give us diminishing marginal product at the firm level. If we require product exhaustion we have factor shares of  0.8 and 0.2.The tricky point is that factor share are 
 $\frac{\alpha}{\alpha + \beta}$ and $\frac{\beta}{\alpha + \beta}$
(*If not there is surplus profit  which we will ignore.)}   
The marginal products pf labour and capital are 
\[MPL=n*\beta_F Y_F/L_F=\$40,000\] and\[\ MPK=\alpha_F Y_F/K_F =0.05\]
From the first, 

\[Y_F=\frac{n*\psi}{\beta_F}=\frac{100*\$40,000}{0.72}=\$5,555,556\]
This is firm revenue. From the MPK, 

\[K_F=  \frac{\alpha_F Y_F }{r}=\frac{0.18 *\$5.5555\ million}{0.05} =\$20\ million = 1.039568 \]

We now have the capital, labour and output for a model firm with a marginal product of labour  equal to the subsistence wage we have chosen. We can calculate the \textbf{scale factor} 

\begin{equation}  
A_F= \frac{Y_F}{K^{\alpha_F} L^{\beta_F}}=\frac{5,555,000}{20,000,000^{\alpha_F} 100^{\beta_F}} = 1.039568 \label{eqn-AR}\end{equation} 
So $A_F$ can be computed using equation~\ref{eqn-AR} for any set of coefficients and firm size. Expanding the expression,

% \begin{equation}  %   arithmetic error here
% A_F 
% =\frac{\frac{n*\psi}{\beta_F}}{\frac{\alpha_F  \left(\frac{n*\psi}{\beta_F} \right)}{r}  L^{\beta_F}} 
% =\frac{\frac{n*\psi}{\beta_F}}{\frac{\alpha_F \frac{n*\psi}{\beta_F} }{r}  L^{\beta_F}} 
% =\frac{r}{\alpha_F  L^{\beta_F} }
% =6.944444e-08???? \label{eqn-AR2}\end{equation} 

Furthermore, we can compute the output for a city of size N if it consists of $N/n$ firms of this type. With a population of 10,000, for example,  there would have to be  100 firms and an output of \$555,555,600. 

 \subsubsection{The urban level of production}
 \textbf{This section now redundant and has been commented out}
% We now consider that this firm operates in the city and enjoys  urban agglomeration benefits. The value of the  marginal product of labour must rise to $\psi+\omega$. We to know  the urban wage premium that is consistent with the subsistence wage. Papageorgiou \cite{papageorgiouOccupationalMatchingCities2022} found a 4.1\% premium. D'costa and Overman   show that working in London is associated with a 35.5\% higher wage than working in a rural area. The comparable figures are
% 10.6\% for big cities and 8.3\% for small cities and an elasticity of wages with respect to city size of 1.6\%.. Estimates of the premium are lower  when they control of individual characteristics.   

% If the $ scale\ coefficient=1.12$, $=\omega$ would be $1.12*\psi$, or $4,800$. 

% This supports an urban wage premium of $\omega\$8,000$.

% We need to have a population size or a number of firms with a firm size. Assume the population is 10,000 and firms still have 100 workers. (All firms will have the same marginal product of labour in a competitive labour market, so size should not matter.)

% \[Y^U=A^R N^\gamma K^\alpha L^\beta = N^\gamma Y^R\]
% where $N^\gamma$ represents the agglomeration effect. The marginal product of labour is 
% \[MPL^u=\$44,800=N^\gamma \beta Y^R/L=N^\gamma *\$40,000\]
% so $N^\gamma= 1.2$ and $\gamma = \frac{log(1.12)}{log(10,000)} =.012$. 


% This value is consistent with an empirical  value for  the agglomeration exponent of $\beta =  1.012$. The value is much lower than empirical estimates. Furthermore, if we consider the same firm structure and a population of one , the value falls, which suggests that agglomeration effects are not scale-independent, but instead increase with urban size. $\beta$ may itself be a function of $N$.

% % A second interesting possible implication of our calculation is that only part of the agglomeration effect appears in wages. Urban rents  are large, but agglomeration effects are much larger.

US multinationals shift twice as much profit as other multinationals relative to the size of their foreign earnings.}

% For some variables, we choose arbitrarily starting values that seem resonable, because that makes it possible to check that variables that follow from computation also seem resonable, as a kind of informal sanity check.

\subsection{Time}
 The computational cycle is a year, so all time-dependent variables, such as wage, transportation cost, and interest rates, are specified for the yearly interval. The mortgage period is set arbitrarily 
 
\subsection{Wage premium} \label{section-wage-premium}

Hirsch Wage \cite{hirschUrbanWagePremium2019} observe that, ``Following Glaeser and Maré \cite{glaeserCitiesSkills2001},  a  large  empirical  literature  has  investigated differences in wages across labour markets of different sizes. The general finding of this literature is that a significant urban wage premium exists. and that this premium consists both of a level effect and a growth effect that arises as workers gain urban work experience.'' 

Almeida et al \cite{almeidaUrbanWagePremium2022} found for Brazil, that the female urban wage premium is on average 11.3\%, almost double the average male premium of 5.7\% and that higher in formal and informal jobs and across various agglomeration levels. The premium is larger in denser areas.

\subsection{Spillover effects} \label{section-spillover}

Spillover effects can be large. Irwin and Klenow  studied learning in chip production focusing  on the key issue of spillovers. They found learning rates of 10 to 27 per cent, averaging 20 per cent. They indicated that a good part of learning is internal, and that national spillovers were no greater than international spillovers. " \dots a firm learns three times as much from an additional unit of its own cumulative output as from another firm's cumulative output, regardless of the other firm's country of location. However, rest-of-world cumulative production is typically more than three times any given firm's cumulative production. This means that the absolute contribution of world cumulative production to each firm's experience outweighs the absolute contribution of its own cumulative production. In this sense, spillovers are substantial." (pp. 1217-1218).


\subsection{Property taxes}

mills

Each mill is expressed as  1/1,000 of the value as determine by assessment \footnote{By capitalizing the mill rate at 5\%  we see that each `mill' is worth about 2\% of the warranted rents. Assessments usually understate the market value considerably. Mill rates are commonly about 1.5 and differ between municipalities. ***MAYBE MOVE PARAM VALUES TO PARAM DISCUSSION}

\section{Transportation costs}
Transport costs have two parts:
1) fuel and vehicle costs per km
2) time costs per km

\subsection{Vehicle related costs}
Use one year as the wage period, converting transportation costs per km to annual cost for consideration in the household budget. Starting with the cost per km, calculate the cost per year:

\textbf{cost per km =$\textit{t}$}:. \$0.59   (from  Ontario data, 2021). sensitive to congestion, use of subways (\$5 /day?), 

 \textbf{work trips per year} 2 way * 5 days/week * 50 weeks work days = 500. [range: 450-550]

\textbf{cost per km-year} = work trips per year*cost per km

=\$0.59/km*500 trips/year  =  \$295/km year 



\subsection{Time costs}
\textbf{time per km}. range: 20km/hr -> 3min/km, 40km/hr -> (1.5min/km - 3min/ km)per trip 

(New York rush hour is much slower:  4-9km/hr ->6-15 min/km)

\textbf{time  per km-year} = work trips per year*time t per trip = 500* 3min  = 1500 min/km year = 25 hours= 3-3.5 days/km
 
\textbf{time cost per km-year} =  (days per km-year /work days/year)*wage premium per year  = 3/250 = 0.012 years/km year. ?

\textbf{money cost of time per km year} 

=time cost per km-year* wage(including subsistence) 

= 0.012 year* wage per year

\subsection{Total cost per km year of commuting for one agent}
\textbf{money cost of time per km year + \$295/km year * distance} \\
= (0.012 w+ \$295)/km year 
    \begin{quotation}
    \textbf{Example}
    To get a sense of the required wage if we have this annual cost structure, assume city\_extent $d^*$ is 30 km. At this point the transport cost is equal to the wage

\[(0.012 w+ \$295)/km year)*30 =  w\] 
\[.36w+ 8850=w\]
\[w=13828.12\]
        \begin{quotation}
        \textbf{PLAUSIBILITY CHECK}
This is plausible land rent, but does not include building rent. 
Capitalized at 5\% this house is worth \$ 276,562, a fairly cheap house 30 miles from city centre

\[ {c}=(0.012 w+ \$295)/km year \]
